<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>ROBERD THE ROBBER.</h3>

  <p>In the <i>Vision of Piers Ploughman</i> are two remarkable passages in
  which mention is made of "Roberd the robber," and of "Roberdes
  knaves."</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Roberd the robbere,</p>
      <p class="i2">On <i>Reddite</i> loked,</p>
      <p class="i1">And for ther was noght wherof</p>
      <p class="i2">He wepte swithe soore."</p>
      <p class="i8">Wright's ed., vol. i. p. 105.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"In glotonye, God woot,</p>
      <p class="i2">Go thei to bedde,</p>
      <p>And risen with ribaudie,</p>
      <p class="i2">The Roberdes knaves."</p>
      <p class="i8">Vol. i. p. 3.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In a note on the second passage, Mr. Wright quotes a statute of Edw.
  III., in which certain malefactors are classed together "qui sont
  appellez <i>Roberdesmen</i>, Wastours, et Dragelatche:" and on the first
  he quotes two curious instances in which the name is applied in a similar
  manner,&mdash;one from a Latin song of the reign of Henry III.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Competenter per <i>Robert</i>, robbur designatur;</p>
      <p>Robertus excoriat, extorquet, et minatur.</p>
      <p><i>Vir quicunque rabidus consors est Roberto</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It seems not impossible that we have in these passages a trace of some
  forgotten mythical personage. "Whitaker," says Mr. Wright, "supposes,
  without any reason, the 'Roberde's knaves' to be 'Robin Hood's men.'"
  (Vol. ii. p. 506.) It is singular enough, however, that as early as the
  time of Henry III. we find the term 'consors Roberto' applied generally,
  as designating any common thief or robber; and without asserting that
  there is any direct allusion to "Robin Hood's men" in the expression
  "Roberdes knaves," one is tempted to ask whence the hero of Sherwood got
  his own name?</p>

  <p>Grimm (<i>Deutsche Mythol.</i>, p. 472.) has suggested that Robin Hood
  may be connected with an equally famous namesake, Robin Goodfellow; and
  that he may have been so called from the hood or hoodikin, which is a
  well-known characteristic of the mischievous elves. I believe, however,
  it is now generally admitted that "Robin Hood" is a corruption <!-- Page
  322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"
  id="page322"></a>{322}</span> of "Robin o' th' Wood" equivalent to
  "silvaticus" or "wildman"&mdash;a term which, as we learn from Ordericus,
  was generally given to those Saxons who fled to the woods and morasses,
  and long held them against their Norman enemies.</p>

  <p>It is not impossible that "Robin o' the Wood" may have been a general
  name for any such outlaws as these and that Robin Hood, as well as
  "Roberd the Robbere" may stand for some earlier and forgotten hero of
  Saxon tradition. It may be remarked that "Robin" is the Norman diminutive
  of "Robert", and that the latter is the name by which we should have
  expected to find the doings of a Saxon hero commemorated. It is true that
  Norman and Saxon soon came to have their feelings and traditions in
  common; but it is not the less curious to find the old Saxon name still
  traditionally applied by the people, as it seems to have been from the
  <i>Vision of Piers Ploughman</i>.</p>

  <p>Whether Robin Goodfellow and his German brother "Knecht Ruprecht" are
  at all connected with Robin Hood, seems very doubtful. The plants which,
  both in England and in Germany, are thus named, appear to belong to the
  elf rather than to the outlaw. The wild geranium, called "Herb Robert" in
  Gerarde's time, is known in Germany as "Ruprecht's Kraut". "Poor Robin",
  "Ragged Robin", and "Robin in the Hose", probably all commemorate the
  same "merry wanderer of the night."</p>

<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN "THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR,"
AND ON CONJECTURAL EMENDATION.</h3>

  <p>The late Mr. Baron Field, in his <i>Conjectures on some Obscure and
  Corrupt Passages of Shakspeare</i>, published in the "Shakspeare
  Society's Papers," vol. ii. p. 47., has the following, note on <i>The
  Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, Act ii. Sc. 2.:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'<i>Falstaff.</i> I myself sometimes having the fear of heaven on the
  left hand, and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to
  hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, you rogue, will esconce your
  <i>rags</i>, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases and your
  bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour.'</p>

  <p>"Pistol, to whom this was addressed, was an ensign, and therefore
  <i>rags</i> can hardly bear the ordinary interpretation. A <i>rag</i> is
  a beggarly fellow, but that will make little better sense here.
  Associated as the phrase is, I think it must mean <i>rages</i>, and I
  find the word used for <i>ragings</i> in the compound <i>bard-rags</i>,
  border-ragings or incursions, in Spenser's <i>Fairy Queen</i>, ii. x.
  63., and <i>Colin Clout</i>, v. 315."</p>

  <p>Having on one occasion found that a petty larceny committed on the
  received text of the poet, by taking away a superfluous <i>b</i>, made
  all clear, perhaps I may be allowed to restore the abstracted letter,
  which had only been <i>misplaced</i> and read <i>brags</i>, with, I
  trust, the like success? Be it remembered that Pistol, a braggadocio, is
  made up of <i>brags</i> and slang; and for that reason I would also read,
  with Hanmer, <i>bull-baiting</i>, instead of the unmeaning
  "<i>bold-beating</i> oaths."</p>

  <p>I well know with what extreme caution conjectural emendation is to be
  exercised; but I cannot consent to carry it to the excess, or to preserve
  a vicious reading, merely because it is warranted by the <i>old
  copies</i>.</p>

  <p>Regretting, as I do, that Mr. Collier's, as well as Mr. Knight's,
  edition of the poet, should both be disfigured by this excess of caution,
  I venture to subjoin a cento from George Withers, which has been
  inscribed in the blank leaf of one of them.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Though they will not for a better</p>
      <p>Change a syllable or letter,</p>
      <p>Must the <i>Printer's</i> spots and stains</p>
      <p>Still obscure THE POET'S Strains?</p>
      <p>Overspread with antique rust,</p>
      <p>Like whitewash on his painted bust</p>
      <p>Which to remove revived the grace</p>
      <p>And true expression of his face.</p>
      <p>So, when I find misplaced B's,</p>
      <p>I will do as I shall please.</p>
      <p>If my method they deride,</p>
      <p>Let them know I am not tied,</p>
      <p>In my free'r course, to chuse</p>
      <p>Such strait rules as they would use;</p>
      <p>Though I something miss of might,</p>
      <p>To express his meaning quite.</p>
      <p>For I neither fear nor care</p>
      <p>What in this their censures are;</p>
      <p>If the art here used be</p>
      <p>Their dislike, it liketh me.</p>
      <p>While I linger on each strain,</p>
      <p>And read, and read it o'er again,</p>
      <p>I am loth to part from thence,</p>
      <p>Until I trace the poet's sense,</p>
      <p>And have the <i>Printer's errors</i> found,</p>
      <p>In which the folios abound."</p>

<h3>Minor Notes</h3>.

  <p><i>Chaucer's Damascene.</i>&mdash;Warton, in his account of the
  physicians who formed the Library of the Doctor of Physic, says of John
  Damascene that he was "Secretary to one of the caliphs, wrote in various
  sciences before the Arabians had entered Europe, and had seen the Grecian
  philosophers." (<i>History of English Poetry</i>, Price's ed., ii. 204.)
  Mr. Saunders, in his book entitled <i>Cabinet Pictures of English
  Life</i>, "Chaucer", after repeating the very words of this meagre
  account, adds, "He was, however, more famous for his religious than his
  medical writings; and obtained for his eloquence the name of the
  Golden-flowing" (p 183.) Now Mr. Saunders certainly, whatever Warton did,
  has confounded Damascenus, the physician, with Johannes Damascenus

  <p><i>Long Friday, meaning of.</i>&mdash;C. Knight, in his <i>Pictorial
  Shakspeare</i>, explains Mrs. Quickly's phrase in <i>Henry the
  Fourth</i>&mdash;"'Tis a <i>long</i> loan for a poor lone woman to
  bear,"&mdash;by the synonym <i>great</i>: asserting that <i>long</i> is
  still used in the sense of great, in the north of England; and quoting
  the Scotch proverb, "Between you and the long day be it," where <i>we</i>
  talk of the <i>great</i> day of judgment. May not this be the meaning of
  the name <i>Long Friday</i>, which was almost invariably used by our
  Saxon forefathers for what we now call Good Friday? The commentators on
  the Prayer Book, who all confess themselves ignorant of the real meaning
  of the term, absurdly suggest that it was so called from the great
  <i>length of the services</i> on that day; or else, from the length of
  the fast which preceded. Surely, The Great Friday, the Friday on which
  the great work of our redemption was completed, makes better sense?</p>

  <p><i>Hip, hip, Hurrah!</i>&mdash;Originally a war cry, adopted by the
  stormers of a German town, wherein a great many Jews had taken their
  refuge. The place being sacked, they were all put to the sword, under the
  shouts of, <i>Hierosolyma est perdita</i>! From the first letter of those
  words (<i>H.e.p.</i>) an exclamation was contrived. We little think, when
  the red wine sparkles in the cup, and soul-stirring toasts are applauded
  by our <i>Hip, hip, hurrah!</i> that we record the fall of Jerusalem, and
  the cruelty of Christians against the chosen people of God.</p>

  <p><i>Under the Rose</i> (Vol. i., p. 214.).&mdash;Near Zandpoort, a
  village in the vicinity of Haarlem, Prince William of Orange, the third
  of his name, had a favourite hunting-seat, called after him the
  Princenbosch, now more generally known under the designation of the
  Kruidberg. In the neighbourhood of these grounds there was a little
  summer-house, making part, if I recollect rightly, of an Amsterdam
  burgomaster's country place, who resided there at the times I speak of.
  In this pavilion, it is said, <i>and beneath a stucco rose</i>, being one
  of the ornaments of the ceiling, William III. communicated the scheme of
  his intended invasion in England to the two burgomasters of Amsterdam
  there present. You know the result.</p>

  <p>Can the expression of "being under the rose" date from this occasion,
  or was it merely owing to coincidence that such an ornament protected, as
  it were, the mysterious conversation to which England owes her liberty,
  and Protestant Christendom the maintenance of its rights?</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES.</h3>

  <p>1. Has anything recently transpired which could lead bibliographers to
  form an absolute decision with regard to the "unknown" printer who used
  the singular letter R which is said to have originated with Finiguerra in
  1452? That Mentelin was the individual seems scarcely credible; and there
  is a manifest difference between his type and that of the anonymous
  printer of the <i>editio princeps</i> of Rabanus Maurus, <i>De
  Universo</i>, the copy of which work (illuminated, ruled, and rubricated)
  now before me was once in Heber's possession; and it exhibits the
  peculiar letter R, which resembles an ill-formed A, destitute of the
  cross stroke, and supporting a round O on its reclined back. (Panzer, i.
  78.; Santander, i. 240.)</p>

  <p>2. Is it not quite certain that the acts and decrees of the synod of
  Würtzburg, held in the year 1452, were printed in that city previously to
  the publication of the <i>Breviarium Herbiplense</i> in 1479? The letter
  Q which is used in the volume of these acts is remarkable for being of a
  double semilunar shape; and the type, which is very Gothic, is evidently
  the same as that employed in an edition of other synodal decrees in
  Germany about the year 1470.</p>

  <p>3. When and where was the <i>Liber de Laudibus gloriosissime Dei
  genitricis Marie semper Virginis</i>, by Albertus Magnus, first printed?
  I do not mean the supposititious work, which is often confounded with the
  other one; but that which is also styled <i>Super Evangelium</i> Missus
  est <i>Quæstiones</i>. And why are these Questions invariably said to be
  230 in number, when there are 275 chapters in the book? Beughem asserts
  that the earliest edition is that of Milan in 1489 (<i>Vid.</i> Quetif et
  Echard, i. 176.), but what I believe to be a volume of older date is
  "sine ullâ notâ;" and a bookseller's observation respecting it is, that
  it is "very rare, and unknown to De Bure, Panzer, Brunet, and Dibdin."
  <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324"
  id="page324"></a>{324}</span></p>

  <p>4. Has any discovery made as to the author of the extraordinary 4to.
  tract, <i>Oracio querulosa contra Inuasores Sacerdotum?</i> According to
  the Crevenna <i>Catalogue</i> (i. 85.), the work is "inconnu à tous les
  bibliographes." Compare Seemiller, ii. 162.; but the copy before me is
  not of the impression described by him. It is worthy of notice, that at
  signature A iiiij the writer declares, "nostris jam temporibus
  calchographiam, hoc est impressioram artem, in nobilissima Vrbanie germe
  Maguncia fuisse repertam."</p>

  <p>5. Are we to suppose that either carelessness or a love of conjectures
  was the source of Chevillier's mistake, not corrected by Greswell
  (<i>Annals of Paris. Typog.</i>, p. 6.), that signatures were first
  introduced, anno 1476, by Zarotus, the printer, at Milan? They may
  doubtless be seen in the <i>Opus Alexandride Ales super tertium
  Sententiarum</i>, Venet. 1475, a book which supplies also the most
  ancient instance I have met with of a "Registrum Chartarum." Signatures,
  however, had a prior existence; for they appear in the
  <i>Mammetractus</i> printed at Beron Minster in 1470 (Meermau, ii. 28.;
  Kloss, p. 192.), but they were omitted in the impression of 1476. Dr.
  Cotton (<i>Typ. Gaz.</i>, p. 66.), Mr. Horne (<i>Introd. to Bibliog.</i>,
  i. 187. 317), and many others, wrongly delay the invention or adoption of
  them till the year 1472.</p>

  <p>6. Is the edition of the <i>Fasciculus Temporum</i>, set forth at
  Cologne by Nicolaus de Schlettstadt in 1474, altogether distinct from
  that which is confessedly "omnium prima," and which was issued by
  Arnoldus Ther Huernen in the same year? If it be, the copy in the Lambeth
  library, bearing date 1476, and entered in pp. 1, 2. of Dr. Maitland's
  very valuable and accurate <i>List</i>, must appertain to the third, not
  the second, impression. To the latter this Louvain reprint of 1476 is
  assigned in the catalogue of the books of Dr. Kloss (p. 127.), but there
  is an error in the remark that the "Tabula" prefixed to the <i>editio
  princeps</i> is comprised in <i>eight</i> leaves, for it certainly
  consists of <i>nine</i>.</p>

  <p>7. Where was what is probably a copy of the second edition of the
  <i>Catena Aurea</i> of Aquinas printed? The folio in question, which
  consists of 417 unnumbered leaves, is an extremely fine one, and I should
  say that it is certainly of German origin. Seemiller (i. 117.) refers it
  to Esslingen, and perhaps an acquaintance with its water-marks would
  afford some assistance in tracing it. Of these a rose is the most common,
  and a strigilis may be seen on folio 61. It would be difficult to
  persuade the proprietor of this volume that it is of so modern a date as
  1474, the year in which what is generally called the second impression of
  this work appeared.</p>

  <p>8. How can we best account for the mistake relative to the imaginary
  Bologna edition of Ptolemy's <i>Cosmography</i> in 1462, a copy of which
  was in the Colbert library? (Leuglet du Fresnoy, <i>Méth. pour étud.
  l'Hist.</i>, iii. 8., à Paris, 1735.) That it was published previously to
  the famous Mentz Bible of this date is altogether impossible; and was the
  figure 6 a misprint for 8? or should we attempt to subvert it into 9? The
  <i>editio princeps</i> of the Latin version by Angelus is in Roman
  letter, and is a very handsome specimen of Vicenza typography in 1475,
  when it was set forth "ab Hermano Leuilapide," alias Hermann
  Lichtenstein.</p>

  <p>9. If it be true, as Dr. Cotton remarks in his excellent
  <i>Typographical Gazetteer</i>, p. 22., that a press was erected at
  Augsburg, in the monastery of SS. Ulric and Afra, in the year 1472, and
  that Anthony Sorg is believed to have been the printer, why should we be
  induced to assent to the validity of Panzer's supposition that Nider's
  <i>Formicarius</i> did not make its appearance there until 1480? It would
  seem to be more than doubtful that Cologne can boast of having produced
  the first edition, A.D. 1475/7; and it may be reasonably asserted, and an
  examination of the book will abundantly strengthen the idea, that the
  earliest impression is that which contains this colophon, in which I
  would dwell upon the word "<i>editionem</i>" (well known to the
  initiated): "Explicit quintus ac totus formicarii liber uxta editionem
  fratris Iohannis Nider," &amp;c., "Impressum Auguste per Anthonium
  Sorg."</p>

  <p>10. In what place and year was <i>Wilhelmi Summa Viciorum</i> first
  printed? Fabricius and Cave are certainly mistaken when they say Colon.
  1479. In the volume, which I maintain to be of greater antiquity, the
  letters <i>c</i> and <i>t</i>, <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>, are curiously
  united, and the commencement of it is: "Incipit summa viciorum seu
  tractatus moral' edita [<i>sic</i>] a fratre vilhelmo episcopo
  lugdun&#277;s. ordinsq. fratrû predicator." The description given by
  Quetif and Echard (i. 132.) of the primary impression of Perault's book
  only makes a bibliomaniac more anxious for information about it: "in Inc.
  typ. absque loco anno et nomine typographi, sine numeris reclamat. et
  majusculis."</p>

  <p>11. Was Panormitan's <i>Lectura super primo Decretalium</i>
  indubitably issued at Venice, prior to the 1st of April, 1473? and if so,
  does it contain in the colophon these lines by Zovenzonius, which I
  transcribe from a noble copy bearing this date?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Abbatis pars prima notis que fulget aliemis</p>
      <p>Est vindelini pressa labore mei:</p>
      <p>Cuius ego ingenium de vertice palladis ortum</p>
      <p>Crediderim. veniam tu mihi spira dabis."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>12. Is it not unquestionable that Heroldt's <i>Promptuarium
  Exemplorum</i> was published at least as early as his <i>Sermones</i>?
  The type in both works is clearly identical, and the imprint in the
  latter, at the end of <i>Serm.</i> cxxxvi., vol. ii., is Colon. 1474, an
  edition unknown to very nearly all bibliographers. For instance, Panzer
  and Denis commence with that of Rostock, in 1476; Laire <!-- Page 325
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>{325}</span>
  with that of Cologne, 1478; and Maittaire with that of Nuremberg, in
  1480. Different statements have been made as to the precise period when
  this humble-minded writer lived. Altamura (<i>Bibl. Domin.</i>, pp. 147.
  500.) places him in the year 1400. Quetif and Echard (i. 762.), Fabricius
  and Mansi (<i>Bibl. Med. et inf. Latin.</i>), prefer 1418, on the
  unstable ground of a testimony supposed to have proceeded from the author
  himself; for whatever confusion or depravation may have been introduced
  into subsequent impressions, the <i>editio princeps</i>, of which I have
  spoken, does not present to our view the alleged passage, viz., "à
  Christo autem transacti sunt <i>millequadringenti decem et octo</i>
  anni," but most plainly, "M.cccc. &amp; liij. anni." (<i>Serm.</i>
  lxxxv., tom. ii.) To this same "Discipulus" Oudin (iii. 2654.), and
  Gerius in the Appendix to Cave (p. 187.), attribute the <i>Speculorum
  Exemplorum</i>, respecting which I have before proposed a Query; but I am
  convinced that they have confounded the <i>Speculum</i> with the
  <i>Promptuarium</i>. The former was first printed at Deventer, A.D. 1481,
  and the compiler of it enters upon his prologue in the following striking
  style: "Impressoria arte jamdudum longe lateque per orbem diffusa,
  multiplicatisque libris quarumcunque fere materiarum," &amp;c. He then
  expresses his surprise at the want of a good collection of
  <i>Exempla</i>; and why should we determine without evidence that he must
  have been Heroldus?</p>

<h3>FAIRFAX'S TASSO.</h3>

  <p>In a copy of Fairfax's <i>Godfrey of Bulloigne</i>, ed. 1600 (the
  first), which I possess, there occurs a very curious variorum reading of
  the first stanza of the first book. The stanza, as it is given by Mr.
  Knight in his excellent modern editions, reads thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"The sacred armies and the godly knight,</p>
      <p>That the great sepulchre of Christ did free,</p>
      <p>I sing; much wrought his valour and foresight,</p>
      <p>And in that glorious war much suffer'd he;</p>
      <p>In vain 'gainst him did hell oppose her might,</p>
      <p>In vain the Turks and Morians armed be;</p>
      <p class="i2">His soldiers wild, to brawls and mutines prest,</p>
      <p class="i2">Reduced he to peace, so heaven him blest."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By holding up the leaf of my copy to the light, it is easy to see that
  the stanza stood originally as given above, but a cancel slip printed in
  <i>precisely the same type</i> as the rest of the book gives the
  following elegant variation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"I sing the warre made in the Holy Land,</p>
      <p>And the Great Chiefe that Christ's great tombe did free:</p>
      <p>Much wrought he with his wit, much with his hand,</p>
      <p>Much in that braue atchieument suffred hee:</p>
      <p>In vaine doth hell that Man of God withstand,</p>
      <p>In vaine the worlds great princes armed bee;</p>
      <p class="i2">For heau'n him fauour'd; and he brought againe</p>
      <p class="i2">Vnder one standard all his scatt'red traine."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Queries.&mdash;1. Does the above variation occur in any or many other
  copies of the edition of 1600?</p>

  <p><i>First Earl of Roscommon.</i>&mdash;Can you or any of your
  correspondents put me on any plan by which I may obtain some information
  on the following subject? James Dillon, first Earl of Roscommon, married
  Helen, daughter of Sir Christopher Barnwell, by whom he had seven sons
  and six daughters; their names were Robert, Lucas, Thomas, Christopher,
  George, John, Patrick. Robert succeeded his father in 1641, and of his
  descendants and those of Lucas and Patrick I have some accounts; but what
  I want to know is, who are the descendants of Thomas (particularly), or
  of any of the other three sons?</p>

  <p>Lodge, in his <i>Peerage</i>, very kindly kills all the sons, Patrick
  included; but it appears that he did not depart this life until he had
  left issue, from whom the late Earl had his origin. If Lodge is thus
  wrong in one case, he may be in others, and I have reason to believe that
  Thomas left a son settled in a place in Ireland called Portlick.</p>

  <p><i>St. Cuthbert.</i>&mdash;The body of St. Cuthbert, as is well known,
  had many wanderings before it found a magnificent resting-place at
  Durham. Now, in an anonymous <i>History of the Cathedral Church of
  Durham</i>, without date, we have a very particular account of the
  defacement of the shrine of St. <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page326" id="page326"></a>{326}</span> Cuthbert, in the reign of
  Henry VIII. The body was found "lying whole, uncorrupt, with his face
  bare, and his beard as of a fortnight's growth, with all the vestments
  about him as he accustomed to say mass withal." The vestments are
  described as being "fresh, safe, and not consumed." The visitors
  "commanded him to be carried into the Revestry, till the king's pleasure
  concerning him was further known; and upon the receipt thereof the prior
  and monks buried him in the ground under the place where his shrine was
  exalted." Now, there is a tradition of the Benedictines (of whose
  monastery the cathedral was part) that on the accession of Elizabeth the
  monks, who were apprehensive of further violence, removed the body in the
  night-time from the place where it had been buried to some other part of
  the building. This spot is known only to three persons, brothers of the
  order; and it is said that there are three persons who have this
  knowledge now, as communicated from previous generations.</p>

  <p>But a discovery was made in 1827 of the remains of a body in the
  centre of the spot where the shrine stood, with various relics of a very
  early period and it was asserted to be the body of St. Cuthbert. This,
  however, has not been universally assented to, and Mr. Akerman, in his
  <i>Archæological Index</i>, has&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The object commonly called St. Cuthbert's Cross" (though the
  designation has been questioned), "found with human remains and other
  relics of the Anglo-Saxon period, in the Cathedral of Durham in
  1827."&mdash;p. 144.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There does seem considerable discrepancy in the statements of the
  remains found in 1827 and the body deposited 1541.</p>

  <p>I will conclude with asking, Is there any evidence to confirm the
  tradition of the Benedictines?</p>

  <p>2. That he may specially call his house a castle.</p>

  <p><i>Alteration of Title-pages.</i>&mdash;Among the advertisements in
  the last <i>Quarterly</i> and <i>Edinburgh Reviews</i>, is one which
  replies to certain criticisms on a work. One of these criticisms was a
  stricture upon its title. The author states that the reviewer had a
  <i>presentation copy</i>, and ought to have inquired into the title under
  which the book was sold to the <i>public</i> before he animaverted upon
  the connexion between the title and the work. It seems then that, in this
  instance, the author furnished the Reviews with a title-page differing
  from that of the body of his impression, and thinks he has a right to
  demand that the reviewers should suppose such a circumstance probable
  enough to make it imperative upon them to inquire what the real title
  was. Query, Is such a practice common? Can any of your readers produce
  another instance?</p>

  Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"
  id="page327"></a>{327}</span> Oliver Chamberlaine," was an "English
  baronet." The absence of his name in any of the Baronetages induces the
  supposition, however, that he had received only the honour of knighthood;
  and the connexion of his son with Dublin, that the statement of Whitelaw
  and Walsh, in their history of that city, may be more correct,&mdash;viz.
  that "Sir Oliver Chamberlaine was descended from a respectable English
  family that had been settled in Dublin since the Reformation." I should
  be glad to be informed on this point, and also respecting the paternity
  of this Sir Oliver, who is not only distinguished as one of the
  progenitors of the Sheridans, but also of Dr. William Chamberlaine, the
  learned author of the <i>Abridgement of the Laws of Jamaica</i>, which he
  for some time administered, as one of the judges in that island; and of

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>GAUDENTIO DI LUCCA.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 247. 298.)</p>

  <p>The <i>Memoirs of Sig. Gaudentio di Lucca</i> have very generally been
  ascribed to Bishop Berkeley. In Moser's <i>Diary</i>, written at the
  close of the last century (MS. penes me), the writer says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I have been reading Berkeley's amusing account of <i>Sig.
  Gaudentio</i>. What an excellent system of patriarchal government is
  there developed!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>See the <i>Retrospective Review</i>, vol iv. p. 316., where the work
  is also ascribed to the celebrated Bishop Berkeley.</p>

  <p class="author">EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.</p>

  <p>In the corrigenda and addenda to Kippis's <i>Biographia
  Britannica</i>, prefixed to vol. iii. is the following note, under the
  head of <i>Berkeley</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"On the same authority [viz., that of Dr. George Berkeley, the
  bishop's son,] we are assured that his father did not write, and never
  read through, the <i>Adventures of Signor Gaudentio di Lucca</i>. Upon
  this head, the editor of the <i>Biographia</i> must record himself as
  having exhibited an instance of the folly of building facts upon the
  foundation of conjectural reasonings. Having heard the book ascribed to
  Bishop Berkeley, and seen it mentioned as his in catalogues of libraries,
  I read over the work again under this impression, and fancied that I
  perceived internal arguments of its having been written by our excellent
  prelate. I was even pleased with the apprehended ingenuity of my
  discoveries. But the whole was a mistake, which, whilst it will be a
  warning to myself, may furnish an instructive lesson to others. At the
  same time, I do not retract the character which I have given of the
  <i>Adventures of Signor Gaudentio di Lucca</i>. Whoever was the author of
  that performance, it does credit to his abilities and to his heart."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After this decisive testimony of Bishop Berkeley's son, accompanied by
  the candid confession of error on the part of the editor of the
  <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, the rumour as to Berkeley's authorship of
  <i>Gaudentio</i> ought to have been finally discredited. Nevertheless, it
  seems still to maintain its ground: it is stated as probable by Dunlop,
  in his <i>History of Fiction</i>; while the writer of a useful Essay on
  "Social Utopias," in the third volume of <i>Chambers's Papers for the
  People</i>, No. 18., treats it as an established fact.</p>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

  <p>In addition to the remarks of your correspondent L., I may state that
  the first edition in 1737, 8vo., contains 335 pages, exclusive of the
  publisher's address, 13 pages. It is printed for T. Cooper, at the Globe,
  in Paternoster Row. The second edition in 1748, 8vo., contains
  publisher's address, 12 pages; the work itself 291 pages.</p>

  <p>I find no difference between the two editions, except that in the
  first the title is <i>The Memoirs of Sigr. Gaudentio di Lucca</i>; and in
  the second, <i>The Adventures of Sigr. Gaudentio di Lucca</i>; and that
  in the second the notes are subjoined to each page, while in the first
  they follow the text in smaller type, as <i>Remarks of Sigr. Rhedi</i>.
  The second edition is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Printed for W. Innys in Paternoster Row, and R. Manby and H.S. Cox on
  Ludgate Hill, and sold by M. Cooper in Paternoster Row."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With respect to the author, it must be observed that there is no
  evidence whatever to justify its being attributed to Bishop Berkeley.
  Clara Reeve, in her <i>Progress of Romana</i>, 1786, 8vo., mentions him
  as having been supposed to be the author; <!-- Page 328 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>{328}</span> but her
  authority seems only to have been the anonymous writer in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. xlvii. p. 13., referred to by your
  correspondent. The author of an elaborate review of the work in the
  <i>Retrospective Review</i>, vol. iv., advocates Bishop Berkeley's claim,
  but gives no reasons of any validity; and merely grounds his persuasion
  upon the book being such as might be expected from that great writer. He
  was, however, at least bound to show some conformity in style, which he
  does not attempt. On the other hand, we have the positive denial of Dr.
  George Berkeley, the bishop's son (Kippis's <i>Biog. Brit.</i>, vol.
  iii., addenda to vol. ii.), which, in the absence of any evidence to the
  contrary, seems to be quite sufficient.</p>

  <p>In a letter signed C.H., <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, vol. vii. p. 317., written
  immediately on the appearance of the work, the writer
  observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I should have been very glad to have seen the author's name prefixed
  to it: however, I am of opinion that it its very nearly related to no
  less a hand than that which has so often, under borrowed names, employed
  itself to amuse and trifle mankind, in their own taste, out of their
  folly and vices."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This appears to point at Swift; but it is quite clear that he could
  not be the author, for very obvious reasons.</p>

  <p>A correspondent of the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, who signs his initials W.H.
  (vol. lv. part 2. p. 757), states "on very good authority" that the
  author was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Barrington, a Catholic priest, who had chambers in Gray's Inn, in
  which he was keeper of a library for the use of the Romish clergy. Mr.
  Barrington wrote it for amusement, in a fit of the gout. He began it
  without any plan, and did not know what he should write about when be put
  pen to paper. He was author of several pamphlets, chiefly anonymous,
  particularly the controversy with Julius Bate on Elohim."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of this circumstantial and sufficiently positive attribution, which is
  dated October, 1785, no contradiction ever appeared that I am aware of.
  The person intended is S. Berington, the author of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Dissertations on the Mosaical Creation, Deluge, building of Babel,
  and Confusion of Tongues, &amp;c." London: printed for the Author, and
  sold by C. Davis in Holborn, and T. Osborn in Gray's Inn, 1750, 8vo.,
  pages 466, exclusive of introduction, 12 pages.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On comparing Gaudentio di Lucca with this extremely curious work,
  there seems a sufficient similarity to bear out the statement of the
  correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, W.H. The author quoted
  in the <i>Remarks of Sigr. Rhedi</i>, and in the <i>Dissertations</i>,
  are frequently the same, and the learning is of the same cast in both. In
  particular, Bochart is repeatedly cited in the <i>Remarks</i> and in the
  <i>Dissertations</i>. The philosophical opinions appear likewise very
  similar.</p>

  <p>On the whole, unless some strong reason can be given for questioning
  the statement of this correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, I
  conceive that S. Berington, of whom I regret that so little is known,
  must be considered to be the author of <i>The Memoirs of Gaudentio di
  Lucca</i>.</p>

<h3>ENGLEMANN'S BIBLIOTHECA SCRIPTORUM CLASSICORUM.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., pp. 296. 312.)</p>

  <p>The sort of defence, explanation, or whatever it may be called,
  founded upon usage, and offered by ANOTHER FOREIGN BOOKSELLER, is
  precisely what I wanted to get out, if it existed, as I suspected it
  did.</p>

  <p>If your correspondent be accurate as to Engelmann, it appears that no
  wrong is done to <i>him</i>; it is only the public which is mystified by
  a variety of title-pages, all but one containing a suppression of the
  truth, and the one of which I speak containing more.</p>

  <p>I now ask you to put in parallel columns extracts from the title given
  by Engelmann with the substitutes given in that which I received.</p>


<table width="81%" class="single" summary="Parallel German and English" title="Parallel German and English">
  <tr>
    <td align="left" width="46%">
      "Schriftsteller&mdash;welche vom Jahre 1700 bis zu Ende des Jahres
      1846 besonders in Deutschland gedruckt worden sind."

    <td align="left" width="7%">
    </td>
    <td valign="top" align="left" width="46%">
      "Classics ... that have appeared in Germany and the adjacent
      countries up to the end of 1846."
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <p>I do not think it fair towards Mr. Engelmann, whose own title is so
  true and so precise, to take it for certain, on anonymous authority, that
  he sanctioned the above paraphrase. According to the German, the
  catalogue contains works from 1700 to 1846, published <i>especially</i>
  in Germany; meaning, as is the fact, that there are some in it published
  elsewhere. According to the English, all classics printed in Germany, and
  all the adjacent countries, in all times, are to be found in the
  catalogue. I pass over the implied compliment to this country, namely,
  that while a true description is required in Germany, a puff both in time
  and space is wanted for England. I dwell on the injurious effect of such
  alterations to literature, and on the trouble they give to those who wish
  to be accurate. It is a system I attack, and not individuals. There is no
  occasion to say much, for publicity alone will do what is wanted,
  especially when given in a journal which falls under the eyes of those
  engaged in research. I hope those of your contributors who think as I do,
  will furnish you from time to time with exposures; if, as a point of
  form, a Query be requisite, they can always end with, Is this right?</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF THE WORD "DELIGHTED."</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., pp. 113. 139. 200. 234.)</p>

  <p>I should have been content to leave the question of the meaning of the
  word <i>delighted</i> as it stands in your columns, my motive, so kindly
  appreciated by Mr. SINGER, in raising the discussion being, by such means
  to arrive at the true meaning of the word, but that the remarks of L.B.L.
  (p. 234.) recall to my mind a canon of criticism which I had intended to
  communicate at an earlier period as useful for the guidance of
  commentators in questions of this nature. It is as follows:&mdash;Master
  the grammatical construction of the passage in question (if from a drama,
  in its dramatic and I scenic application), deducing therefrom the general
  sense, before you attempt to amend or fix the meaning of a doubtful
  word.</p>

  <p>Of all writers, none exceed Shakspeare in logical correctness and
  nicety of expression. With a vigour of thought and command of language
  attained by no man besides, it is fair to conclude, that he would not be
  guilty of faults of construction such as would disgrace a school-boy's
  composition; and yet how unworthily is he treated when we find some of
  his finest passages vulgarised and degraded through misapprehensions
  arising from a mere want of that attention due to the very least, not to
  say the greatest, of writers. This want of attention (without attributing
  to it such fatal consequences) appears to me evident in L.B.L.'s remarks,
  ably as he analyses the passage. I give him credit for the faith that
  enabled him to discover a sense in it as it stands; but when he says that
  it is perfectly intelligible in its natural sense, it appears to me that
  he cannot be aware of the innumerable explanations that have been offered
  of this very clear passage. The source of his error is plainly referable
  to the cause I have pointed out.</p>

  <p>It is quite true that, in the passage referred to, the condition of
  the body before and after death is contrasted, but this is merely
  incidental. The natural antithesis of "a sensible warm motion" is
  expressed in "a kneaded clod" and "cold obstruction;" but the terms of
  the other half of the passage are not quite so well balanced. On the
  other hand, it is not the contrasted condition of each, but the
  separation of the body and spirit&mdash;that is, <i>death</i>&mdash;which
  is the object of the speaker's contemplation. Now with regard to the
  meaning of the term <i>delighted</i>, L.B.L. says it is applied to the
  spirit "<i>not</i> in its state <i>after death</i>, but <i>during
  life</i>." I must quote the lines once more:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;</p>
      <p>To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;</p>
      <p>This sensible warm motion to become</p>
      <p>A kneaded clod; <i>and</i> the delighted spirit</p>
      <p>To bathe in fiery floods," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And if I were to meet with a hundred thousand passages of a similar
  construction, I am confident they would only confirm the view that the
  spirit is represented in the <i>then present</i> state as at the
  termination of the former clause of the sentence. If such had not been
  the view instinctively taken by all classes of readers, there could have
  been no difficulty about the meaning of the word.</p>

  <p>As a proof that this view of the construction is correct, let L.B.L.
  substitute for "delighted spirit", <i>spirit no longer delighted</i>, and
  he will find that it gives precisely the sense which he deduces from the
  passage as it stands. If this be true, then, according to his view, the
  negative and affirmative of a proposition may be used indifferently, in
  the same time and circumstances giving exactly the same meaning.</p>

  <p>MR. SINGER furnishes another instance (Vol. ii., p. 241.) of the value
  of my canon. I think there can be no doubt that his explanation of the
  meaning of the word <i>eisell</i> is correct; but if it were not, any way
  of reading the passage in which it occurs would lead me to the conclusion
  that it could not be a river. <i>Drink up</i> is synonymous with <i>drink
  off</i>, <i>drink to the dregs</i>. A child, taking medicine, is urged to
  "drink it up." The idea of the passage appears to be that each of the
  acts should go beyond the last preceding in extravagance:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't tear thyself?</p>
      <p>Woo't drink up eisell?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And then comes the climax&mdash;"eat a crocodile?" Here is a regular
  succession of feats, the last but one of which is sufficiently wild,
  though not unheard of, and leading to the crowning extravagance. The
  notion of drinking up a river would be both unmeaning and out of
  place.</p>

<h3>THE COLLAR OF ESSES.</h3>

  <p>I shall look with interest to the documents announced by Dr. ROCK
  (Vol. ii., p. 280.), which in his mind connect the Collar of Esses with
  the "Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus" of the Salisbury liturgy: but hitherto I
  have found nothing in any of the devices of livery collars that partakes
  of religious allusion. I am well aware that many of the collars of
  knighthood of modern Europe, headed by the proud order of the Saint
  Esprit, display sacred emblems and devices. But the livery collars were
  perfectly distinct from collars of knighthood. The latter, indeed, did
  not exist until a subsequent age: and this was one of the most monstrous
  of the popular errors which I had to combat in my papers in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>. A Frenchman named Favyn, at the commencement
  of the seventeenth century, published <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>{330}</span> a folio
  book on Orders of Knighthood, and, giving to many of them an antiquity of
  several centuries,&mdash;often either fabulous or greatly
  exaggerated,&mdash;provided them all with imaginary collars, of which he
  exhibits engravings. M. Favyn's book was republished in English, and his
  collars have been handed down from that time to this, in all our heraldic
  picture-books. This is one important warning which it is necessary to
  give any one who undertakes to investigate this question. From my own
  experience of the difficulty with which the mind is gradually disengaged
  from preconceived and prevailing notions on such points, which it has
  originally adopted as admitting of no question, I know it is necessary to
  provide that others should not view my arguments through a different
  medium to myself. And I cannot state too distinctly, even if I incur more
  than one repetition, that the Collar of Esses was not a badge of
  knighthood nor a badge of personal merit; but it was a collar of livery;
  and the idea typified by livery was feudal dependence, or what we now
  call party. The earliest livery collar I have traced is the French order
  of <i>cosses de geneste</i>, or broomcods: and the term "order", I beg to
  explain, is in its primary sense exactly equivalent to "livery:" it was
  used in France in that sense <i>before</i> it came to be applied to
  orders of knighthood. Whether there was any other collar of livery in
  France, or in other countries of Europe, I have not hitherto ascertained;
  but I think it highly probable that there was. In England we have some
  slight glimpses of various collars, on which it would be too long here to
  enter; and it is enough to say, that there were only two of the king's
  livery, the Collar of Esses and the Collar of Roses and Suns. The former
  was the collar of our Lancastrian kings, the latter of those of the house
  of York. The Collar of Roses and Suns had appendages of the heraldic
  design which was then called "the king's beast," which with Edward IV.
  was the white lion of March, and with Richard III. the white boar. When
  Henry VII. resumed the Lancastrian Collar of Esses, he added to it the
  portcullis of Beaufort. In the former Lancastrian regions it had no
  pendant, except a plain or jewelled ring, usually of the trefoil form.
  All the pendant badges which I have enumerated belong to secular
  heraldry, as do the roses and suns which form the Yorkist collar. The
  letter S is an emblem of a somewhat different kind; and, as it proves,
  more difficult to bring to a satisfactory solution than the symbols of
  heraldic blazon. As an initial it will bear many interpretations&mdash;it
  may be said, an indefinite number, for every new &#338;dipus has some
  fresh conjecture to propose. And this brings me to render the account
  required by Dr. Rock of the reasons which led me to conclude that the
  letter S originated with the office of Seneschallus or Steward. I must
  still refer to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1842, or to the
  republication of my essays which I have already promised, for fuller
  details of the evidence I have collected; but its leading results, as
  affecting the origin of this device, may be stated as follows:&mdash;It
  is ascertained that the Collar of Esses was given by Henry, Earl of
  Derby, afterwards King Henry IV., during the life-time of his father,
  John of Ghent, Duke of Lancaster. It also appears that the Duke of
  Lancaster himself gave a collar, which was worn in compliment to him by
  his nephew King Richard II. In a window of old St. Paul's, near the
  duke's monument, his arms were in painted glass, accompanied with the
  Collar of Esses; which is presumptive proof that his collar was the same
  as that of his son, the Earl of Derby. If, then, the Collar of Esses was
  first given by this mighty duke, what would be <i>his</i> meaning in the
  device? My conjecture is, that it was the initial of the title of that
  high office which, united to his vast estates, was a main source of his
  weight and influence in the country,&mdash;the office of Steward of
  England. This, I admit, is a derivation less captivating in idea than
  another that has been suggested, viz. that S was the initial of
  <i>Souveraine</i> which is known to have been a motto subsequently used
  by Henry IV., and which might be supposed to foreshadow the ambition with
  which the House of Lancaster affected the crown. But the objection to
  this is, that the device is traced back earlier than the Lancastrian
  usurpation can be supposed to have been in contemplation. It might still
  be the initial of <i>Souveraine</i>, if John of Ghent adopted it in
  allusion to his kingdom of Castille: but, because he is supposed to have
  used it, and his son the Earl of Derby certainly used it, after the
  sovereignty of Castille had been finally relinquished, but also before
  either he or his son can be supposed to have aimed at the sovereignty of
  their own country, therefore it is that, in the absence of any positive
  authority, I adhere at present to the opinion that the letter S was the
  initial of Seneschallus or Steward.</p>

  <p><i>Collar of SS</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 89. 194. 248. 280.).&mdash;I am

  evidently no <i>spiritual</i> or <i>literary</i> derivation from the
  initial letters of <i>Sovereign</i>, <i>Sanctus</i>, <i>Seneschallus</i>,
  or any similar word. It is (as MR. ELLACOMBE hints, p. 248.) purely
  descriptive of the <i>mechanical</i> mode of forming the chain, not by
  round or closed links, but by hooks alternately deflected into the shape
  of <i>esses</i>; thus, <img src="images/010.png" alt="3 sideways capital

  ornament than other forms of links) may not have been in special use for
  particular <!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"
  id="page331"></a>{331}</span> purposes, I will not say; but I have no
  doubt that the <i>name</i> means no more than that the links were in the

<h3>SIRLOIN.</h3>

  <p>Several correspondents who treat of Lancashire matters do not appear
  to be sufficiently careful to ascertain the correct designations of the
  places mentioned in their communications. In a late number Mr. J.G.
  NICHOLS gave some very necessary corrections to CLERICUS CRAVENSIS
  respecting his note on the "Capture of King Henry VI." (Vol. ii., p.
  181.); and I have now to remind H.C. (Vol. ii., p. 268.) that "Haughton
  Castle" ought to be "Hoghton Tower, near Blackburn, Lancashire." Hoghton
  Tower and Whittle Springs have of late been much resorted to by pic-nic
  parties from neighbouring towns; and from the interesting scenery and
  splendid prospects afforded by these localities, they richly deserve to
  be classed among the <i>lions</i> of Lancashire. It is not improbable
  that the far-famed beauties and rugged grandeur of "The Horr" may, for
  the time, have rendered it impossible for H.C. to attend to orthography
  and the simple designation "Hoghton Tower," and hence the necessity for
  the present Note.</p>

  <p>The popular tradition of the knighting of the Sirloin has found its
  way into many publications of a local tendency, and, amongst the rest,
  into the graphic <i>Traditions of Lancashire</i>, by the late Mr. Roby,
  whose premature death in the Orion steamer we have had so recently to
  deplore. Mr. Roby, however, is not disposed to treat the subject very
  seriously; for after stating that Dr. Morton had preached before the king
  on the duty of obedience, "inasmuch as it was rendered to the vicegerent
  of heaven, the high and mighty and puissant James, Defender of the Faith,
  and so forth," he adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"After this comfortable and gracious doctrine, there was a rushbearing
  and a piping before the king in the great quadrangle. Robin Hood and Maid
  Marian, with the fool and Hobby Horse, were, doubtless, enacted to the
  jingling of morris-dancers and other profanities. These fooleries put the
  king into such good humour, that he was more witty in his speech than
  ordinary. Some of these sayings have been recorded, and amongst the rest,
  <i>that well-known quibble which has been the origin of an absurd
  mistake, still current through the county, respecting the sirloin</i>.
  The occasion, as far as we have been able to gather, was thus. Whilst he
  sat at meat, casting his eyes upon a noble <i>surloin</i> at the lower
  end of the table, he cried out, 'Bring hither that <i>surloin</i>,
  sirrah, for 'tis worthy a more honourable post, being, as I may say, not
  <i>sur</i>-loin, but <i>sir</i>-loin, the noblest joint of all;' which
  ridiculous and desperate pun raised the wisdom and reputation of
  England's Solomon to the highest."&mdash;<i>Traditions</i>, vol. ii. pp.

  <p>Most probably Mr. Roby's view of the matter is substantially correct;
  for although <i>tradition</i> never fails to preserve the remembrance of
  transactions too trivial, or perhaps too indistinct for sober history to
  narrate, the <i>existence</i> of a tradition does not necessarily
  <i>prove</i>, or even <i>require</i>, that the myth should have had its
  foundation in fact.</p>

  <p>Had the circumstance really taken place as tradition prescribes, it
  would probably have obtained a greater permanency than oral recital; for
  during the festivities at Hoghton Tower, on the occasion of the visit of
  the "merrie monarch", there was present a gentleman after Captain
  Cuttle's own heart, who would most assuredly have made a note of it. This
  was Nicholas Assheton, Esq., of Downham, whose <i>Journal</i>, as Dr.
  Whitaker well observes, furnishes an invaluable record of "our ancestors
  of the parish of Whalley, not merely in the universal circumstances of
  birth, marriage, and death, but acting and suffering in their individual
  characters; their businesses, sports, bickerings, carousings, and, such
  as it was, religion." This worthy chronicler thus describes the King's
  visit:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"August 15. (1617). The king came to Preston; ther, at the crosse, Mr.
  Breares, the lawyer, made a speche, and the corpor<sup>n</sup> presented
  him with a bowle; and then the king went to a banquet in the town-hall,
  and soe away to Houghton: ther a speche made. Hunted, and killed a stagg.
  Wee attend on the lords' table.</p>

  <p>"August 16, Houghton. The king hunting: a great companie: killed
  affore dinner a brace of staggs. Verie hot: soe hee went in to dinner.
  Wee attend the lords' table, ab<sup>t</sup> four o'clock the king went
  downe to the Allome mynes, and was ther an hower, and viewed them
  p[re]ciselie, and then went and shott at a stagg, and missed. Then my
  Lord Compton had lodged two brace. The king shott again, and brake the
  thigh-bone. A dogg long in coming, and my Lo. Compton shott
  ag<sup>n</sup> and killed him. Late in to supper.</p>

  <p>"Aug. 17, Houghton. Wee served the lords with biskett, wyne, and
  jellie. The Bushopp of Chester, Dr. Morton, p[re]ched before the king. To
  dinner. Ab<sup>t</sup> four o'clock, ther was a rush-bearing and piping
  affore them, affore the king in the middle court; then to supp. Then
  ab<sup>t</sup> ten or eleven o'clock, a maske of noblemen, knights,
  gentlemen, and courtiers, affore the king, in the middle round, in the
  garden. Some speeches: of the rest, dancing the Huckler, Tom Bedlo, and
  the Cowp Justice of Peace.</p>

  <p>"Aug. 18. The king went away ab<sup>t</sup> twelve to Lathome."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The journalist who would note so trivial a circumstance as the heat of
  the weather, was not likely to omit the knighting of the Sirloin, if it
  really occurred; and hence, in the absence of more positive proof, we are
  disposed to take Mr. Roby's view of the case, and treat it as one of the
  thousand and one pleasant stories which "rumour with her hundred tongues"
  ever circulates amongst the peasantry of a district where some royal
  visit, or <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"
  id="page332"></a>{332}</span> other unexpected memorable occurrence, has
  taken place.</p>

  <p>But this is not the only "pleasant conceit" of which the "merrie
  monarch" is said to have delivered himself during his visit to Hoghton
  Tower. On the way from Preston his attention was attracted by a huge
  boulder stone which lay in the roadside, and was still in existence not a
  century ago. "O' my saul," cried he, "that meikle stane would build a
  bra' chappin block for my Lord Provost. Stop! there be letters thereon:
  unto what purport?" Several voices recited the inscription:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>Turn me o're, an I'le tel thee plaine.</i>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Then turn it ower," said the monarch, and a long and laborious toil
  brought to light the following satisfactory intelligence:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>Hot porritch makes hard cake soft,</i></p>
      <p><i>So torne me o'er againe.</i>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"My saul," said the king, "ye shall gang roun' to yere place again:
  these country gowks mauna ken the riddle without the labour." As a
  natural consequence, Sir Richard Hoghton's "great companie" would require
  a correspondingly great quantity of provisions; and the tradition in the
  locality is, that the subsequent poverty of the family was owing to the
  enormous expenses incurred under this head; the following characteristic
  anecdote being usually cited in confirmation of the current opinion.
  During one of the hunting excursions the king is said to have left his
  attendants for a short time, in order to examine a numerous herd of
  horned cattle then grazing in what are now termed the "Bullock Pastures,"
  most of which had probably been provided for the occasion. A day or two
  afterwards, being hunting in the same locality, he made inquiry
  respecting the cattle, and was told, in no good-humoured way, by a
  herdsman unacquainted with his person, that they were all gone to feast
  the beastly king and his gluttonous company. "By my saul," exclaimed the
  king, as he left the herdsman, "then 'tis e'en time for me to gang too:"
  and accordingly, on the following morning, he set out for Lathom
  House.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, allow me to ask the correspondents to the "NOTES AND
  QUERIES," what is meant by "dancing the <i>Huckler</i>, <i>Tom Bedlo</i>,
  and the <i>Cowp Justice of Peace</i>?"</p>

  of beef, the part ever since called the <i>sirloin</i>. Those who would
  credit this story have the authority of Dr. Johnson to support them,
  among whose explanations of the word <i>sir</i> in his dictionary, is
  that it is 'a title given to the loin of beef, which one of our kings
  knighted in a fit of good humour.' 'Surloin,' says Dr. Pegge (<i>Gent.
  Mag.</i>, vol. liv. p. 485.), 'is, I conceive, if not knighted by King
  James as is reported, compounded of the French <i>sur</i>, upon, and the
  English <i>loin</i>, for the sake of euphony, our particles not easily
  submitting to composition. In proof of this, the piece of beef so called
  grows upon the <i>loin</i>, and behind the small ribs of the animal.' Dr.
  Pegge is probably right, and yet the king, if he did not give the sirloin
  its name, might, notwithstanding, have indulged in a pun on the already
  coined word, the etymology of which was then, as now, as little regarded
  as the thing signified is well approved."</p>

<h3>RIOTS OF LONDON.</h3>

  <p>The reminiscences of your correspondent SENEX concerning the riots of
  London in the last century form an interesting addition to the records of
  those troubled times; but in all these matters correctness as to dates
  and facts are of immense importance. The omission of a date, or the
  narration of events out of their proper sequence, will sometimes create
  vast and most mischievous confusion in the mind of the reader. Thus, from
  the order in which SENEX has stated his reminiscences, a reader
  unacquainted with the events of the time will be likely to assume that
  the "attack on the King's Bench prison" and "the death of Allen" arose
  out of, and formed part and parcel of, the Gordon riots of 1780, instead
  of one of the Wilkes tumults of 1768. By the way, if SENEX was
  "personally either an actor or spectator" in <i>this</i> outbreak, he
  fully establishes his claim to the signature he adopts. I quite agree
  with him that monumental inscriptions are not always remarkable for their
  truth, and that the one in this case may possibly be somewhat tinged with
  popular prejudice or strong parental feeling; but, at all events, there
  can be but little doubt that poor Allen, whether guilty or innocent, was
  shot by a soldier of the Scotch regiment, be his name what it may; and
  further, the deed was not the effect of a random shot fired upon the
  mob,&mdash;for the young man was chased into a cow-house, and shot by his
  pursuer, away from the scene of conflict. <!-- Page 333 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>{333}</span></p>

  <p>Noorthouck, who published his <i>History of London</i>, 1773, thus
  speaks of the affair:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The next day, May 10. (1768,) produced a more fatal instance of rash
  violence against the people on account of their attachment to the popular
  prisoner (Wilkes) in the King's Bench. The parliament being to meet on
  that day to open the session, great numbers of the populace thronged
  about the prison from an expectation that Mr. W. would on that occasion
  recover his liberty; and with an intention to conduct him to the House of
  Commons. On being disappointed, they grew tumultuous, and an additional
  party of the third regiment of Guards were sent for. Some foolish paper
  had been stuck up against the prison wall, which a justice of the peace,
  then present, was not very wise in taking notice of, for when he took it
  down the mob insisted on having it from him, which he not regarding, the
  riot grew louder, the drums beat to arms, the proclamation was read, and
  while it was reading, some stones and bricks were thrown. William Allen,
  a young man, son of Mr. Allen, keeper of the Horse Shoe Inn in Blackman
  Street, and who, <i>as appeared afterwards, was merely a quiet
  spectator</i>, being pursued along with others, was unfortunately singled
  out and followed by three soldiers into a cow-house, and shot dead! A
  number of horse-grenadiers arrived, and these hostile measures having no
  tendency to disperse the crowd, which rather increased, the people were
  fired upon, five or six were killed, and about fifteen wounded; among
  which were two women, one of whom afterwards died in the hospital."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The author adds,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The soldiers were next day publicly thanked by a letter from the
  Secretary-at-War in his master's name. McLaughlin, who actually killed
  the inoffensive Allen, was withdrawn from justice and could never be
  found, so that though his two associates Donald Maclaine and Donald
  Maclaury, with their commanding officer Alexander Murray, were proceeded
  against for the murder, the prosecution came to nothing and only
  contributed to heighten the general discontent."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With respect to the monument in St. Mary's, Newington, I extract the
  following from the <i>Oxford Magazine</i> for 1769, p. 39.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Tuesday, July 25. A fine large marble tombstone, elegantly finished,
  was erected over the grave of Mr. Allen, junr., in the church-yard of St.
  Mary, Newington, Surry. It had been placed twice before, but taken away
  on some disputed points. On the sides are the following
  inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>North Side.</i></p>

<p class="center">Sacred to the Memory of<br />
William Allen,</p>

  <p>An Englishman of unspotted life and amiable disposition, [who was
  inhumanely murdered near St. George's Fields, the 10th day of May, 1768,
  by the Scottish detachment from the army.]<a id="footnotetag1"
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"His disconsolate parents, <i>inhabitants of this parish</i>, caused
  this tomb to be erected to an only son, lost to them and the world, in
  his twentieth year, as a monument of his virtues and their
  affections."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At page 53. of the same volume is a copperplate representing the tomb.
  On one side appears a soldier leaning on his musket. On his cap is
  inscribed "3rd Regt.;" his right hand points to the tomb; and a label
  proceeding from his mouth represents him saying, "I have obtained a
  pension of a shilling a day only for putting an end to thy days." At the
  foot of the tomb is represented a large thistle, from the centre of which
  proceeds the words, "Murder screened and rewarded."</p>

  <p>Accompanying this print are, among other remarks, the
  following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It was generally believed that he was m&mdash;&mdash;d by one
  Maclane, a Scottish soldier of the 3d Reg<sup>t</sup>. The father
  prosecuted, Ad&mdash;&mdash;n undertook the defence of the soldier. The
  solicitor of the Treasury, Mr. Nuthall, the deputy-solicitor, Mr.
  Francis, and Mr. Barlow of the Crown Office, attended the trial, and it
  is said, paid the whole expence for the prisoner out of the Treasury, to
  the amount of a very considerable sum. The defence set up was, that young
  Allen was not killed by Maclane, but by another Scottish soldier of the
  same regiment, one McLaughlin, who confessed it at the time to the
  justice, as the justice says, though he owns he took no one step against
  a person who declared himself a murderer in the most express terms....
  The perfect innocence of the young man as to the charge of being
  concerned in any riot or tumult, is universally acknowledged, and a more
  general good character is nowhere to be found. This McLaughlin soon made
  his escape, therefore was a deserter as well as a murtherer, yet he has
  had a discharge sent him with an allowance of a shilling a day."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Maclane was most probably the "Mac" alluded to by SENEX; but his
  account differs in so many respects from cotemporaneous records that I
  have ventured to trespass somewhat largely upon your space. I may add,
  that I by no means agree in the propriety of erasing a monumental
  inscription of more than eighty years' existence without some much
  stronger proof of its falsehood; for I quite coincide with the remarks of
  Rev. D. Lysons, in his allusion to this monument (<i>Surrey</i>, p.
  393.), that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Allen was illegally killed, whether he was concerned in the riots or
  not, <i>as he was shot apart from the mob at a time when he might, if
  necessary, have been apprehended and brought to justice</i>."</p>

<h3>MEANING OF "GRADELY."</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 133.)</p>

  <p>For the origin of this word, A.W.H. may refer to Brocket's <i>Glossary
  of North Country Words</i>, where he will find&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Gradely, decently, orderly. Sax. <i>grad</i>, <i>grade,</i> ordo.
  Rather, Mr. Turner says, from Sax. <i>gradlie</i> upright; <i>gradely</i>
  in Lanc., he observes, is an adjective simplifying everything
  respectable. The Lancashire people say, our <i>canny</i> is nothing to
  it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The word itself is very familiar to me, as I have often received a
  scolding for some boyish, and therefore not very wise or orderly prank,
  in these terns:&mdash;"One would think you were not altogether gradely,"
  or, as it was sometimes varied into, "You would make one believe you were
  not <i>right in your head;</i>" meaning, "One would think you had not
  common sense."</p>

  <p class="author">H. EASTWOOD.</p>

  <p>Ecclesfield.</p>

  <p><i>Gradely.</i>&mdash;This word is not only used in Yorkshire, but
  also very much in Lancashire, and the rest of the north of England. I
  have always understood it to mean "good," "jolly," "out and out." Its
  primary meaning is "orderly, decently." (See Richardson's
  <i>Dictionary</i>.) The French have <i>grade</i>; It. and Sp.,
  <i>grado</i>; Lat. <i>gradus</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">AREDJID KOOEZ.</p>

  <p><i>Gradely.</i>&mdash;This word, in use in Lancashire and Yorkshire,
  means <i>grey-headedly</i>, and denotes such wisdom as should belong to
  old age. A child is admonished to do a thing <i>gradely</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
  with the care and caution of a person of experience.</p>

  <p class="author">E.H.</p>

  <p><i>Gradely.</i>&mdash;In Webster's and also in Richardson's
  <i>Dictionaries</i> it is defined, "orderly, decently." It is a word in
  common use in Lancashire and Yorkshire, and also Cheshire. A farmer will
  tell his men to do a thing gradely, that is, "properly, well."</p>

  <p class="author">G.W.N.</p>

  <p><i>Gradely.</i>&mdash;In Carr's <i>Craven Dialect</i> appears
  "<i>Gradely</i>, decently." It is also used as an adjective, "decent,
  worthy, respectable."</p>

  <p>2. Tolerably well, "How isto?" "<i>Gradely.</i>" Fr. <i>Gré</i>,
  "satisfaction"; <i>à mon gré.</i></p>

  <p class="author">S.N.</p>

  <p><i>Gradely.</i>&mdash;Holloway<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> derives <i>gradely</i> from the
  Anglo-Saxon <i>Grade</i>, a step, order, and defines its meaning,
  "decently." He, however, fixes its paternity in the neighbouring county
  of York.</p>

  <p>In Collier's edition of <i>Tim Bobbin</i> it is spelt <i>greadly</i>,
  and means "well, right, handsomely."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I connaw tell the <i>greadly</i>, boh I think its to tell fok
  by."&mdash;p. 42.</p>

  <p>"So I seete on restut meh, on drank meh pint o ele; boh as I'r naw
  <i>greadly</i> sleekt, I cawd for another," &amp;c.&mdash;p. 45.</p>

  <p>"For if sitch things must be done <i>greadly</i> on os teh aught to
  bee," &amp;c.&mdash;p. 59.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Halliwell<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> defined it, "decently, orderly,
  moderately," and gives a recent illustration of its use in a letter
  addressed to Lord John Russell, and distributed in the Manchester Free
  Trade Procession. It is dated from Bury, and the writer says to his
  lordship,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Dunnot be fyert, mon, but rapt eawt wi awt uts reef, un us Berry
  foke'll elp yo as ard as we kon. Wayn helps Robdin, un wayn elp yo, if
  yoan set obeawt yur work <i>gradely</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Gradely.</i>&mdash;I think this word is very nearly confined to
  Lancashire. It is used both as an adjective and adverb. As an adjective,
  it expresses only a moderate degree of approbation or satisfaction; as an
  adverb, its general force is much greater. Thus, used adjectively in such
  phrases as "a gradely man," "a gradely crop," &amp;c., it is synonymous
  with "decent." In answer to the question, "How d'ye do?" it means,
  "Pretty well," "Tolerable, thank you."</p>

  <p>Adverbially it is (1.) sometimes used in sense closely akin to that of
  the adjective. Thus in "Behave yourself gradely," it means "properly,
  decently." But (2.) most frequently it is precisely equivalent to "very;"
  as in the expressions "A gradely fine day," "a gradely good
  man"&mdash;which last is a term of praise by no means applicable to the
  mere gradely man, or, as such a one is most commonly described, a
  "gradely sort of man."</p>

  <p>Though one might have preferred a Saxon origin for it, yet in default
  of such it seems most natural to connect it with the Latin <i>gradus</i>,
  especially as the word <i>grade</i>, from which it is immediately formed,
  has a handy English look about it, that would soon naturalise it amongst
  us. <i>Gradely</i> <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page335" id="page335"></a>{335}</span> then would mean "orderly,
  regular, according to degree."</p>

  <p>The difference in intensity of meaning between the adjective and the
  adverb seems analogous to that between the adjectives proper,
  <i>regular</i>, &amp;c., and the same words when used in the vulgar way
  as adverbs.</p>

<h3>PASCAL AND HIS EDITOR BOSSUT.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 278.)</p>

  <p>Although I am not afraid of the fate with which that unfortunate monk
  met, of whom it is said,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Pro solo puncto caruit Martinus Asello,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>yet a blunder is a sad thing, especially when the person who is
  supposed to commit it attempts to correct others.</p>

  <p>Now the printer of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" has introduced, in my short
  remark on Pascal, the <i>very error</i> which has led the author of the
  article in the <i>British Quarterly Review</i>, as well as many others,
  to mistake the Bishop of Meaux for the editor of Pascal's works. Once
  more, that unfortunate editor is BOSSUT, not BOSSUET; and if it may
  appear to some that the difference of one letter in a name is not of much
  consequence, yet it is from an error as trifling as this that people of
  my acquaintance confound Madame de Staël with Madame de Staal-Delauney,
  in spite of chronology and common sense. Again, by the leave of the
  <i>Christian Remembrancer</i> (vol. xiii. no. 55.), the elegant and
  accomplished scholar to whom we owe the only complete text of Pascal's
  thoughts, is M. Faugère, not Fougère. All these are minutiæ; but the
  chapter of minutiæ is an important one in literary history.</p>

  <p>Another remarkable question which I feel a wish to touch upon before
  closing this communication, is that of <i>impromptus</i>. Your
  correspondent MR. SINGER (p. 105.) supposes Malherbe the poet to have
  been "ready at an impromptu." But, to say the least, this is rather
  doubtful, unless the extemporaneous effusions of Malherbe were of that
  class which Voiture indulged in with so much success at the Hôtel de
  Rambouillet&mdash;sonnets and epigrams leisurely prepared for the purpose
  of being fired off in some fashionable "<i>ruelle</i>" of Paris. Malherbe
  is known to have been a very slow composer; he used to say to Balzac that
  ten years' rest was necessary after the production of a hundred lines:
  and the author of the <i>Christian Socrates</i>, himself rather too fond
  of the file, after quoting this fact, adds in a letter to Consart:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Je n'ai pas besoin d'un si long repos après un si petit travail. Mais
  aussi d'attendre de moi cette heureuse facilité qui fait produire des
  volumes à M. de Scudéry, ce serait me connaître mal, et me faire une
  honneur que je ne mérite pas."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Malherbe certainly had a most happy influence on French poetry; he
  checked the ultra-classical school of Ronsard, and began that work of
  reformation afterwards accomplished by Boileau.</p>

  <p>As I have mentioned Voiture's name, I shall add a very droll
  "<i>soi-disant</i>" impromptu of his, composed to ridicule Mademoiselle
  Chapelain, the sister of the poet. Like her brother, she was most miserly
  in her habits, and not distinguished by that virtue which some say is
  next to godliness.</p>

<h3>KONGS-SKUGG-SIO.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 298.)</p>

  <p>The author of the <i>Kongs-skugg-sio</i> is unknown, but the date of
  it has been pretty clearly made out by Bishop Finsen and others.
  (<i>V.</i> Finsen, <i>Dissertatio Historica de Speculo Regali</i>, 1766.)
  There is only one complete edition of this remarkable work, viz. that
  published at Soröe in 1768, in 4to. Bishop Finsen maintains the
  <i>Kongs-skugg-sio</i> to have been written from 1154 to 1164. Ericksen
  believes it not to be older than 1184; while Suhm and Eggert Olafsen do
  not allow it to be older than the thirteenth century. Rafn, and the
  modern editors of the <i>Grönlands Historiske Mindesmærker</i>, p. 266.,
  vol. iii., accept the date given by Finsen as the true one. From the text
  of the work we learn that it was written in Norway, by a young man, a son
  of one of the leading and richest men there, who had been on terms of
  friendship with several kings, and had lived much, or at least had
  travelled much, in Helgeland. Rafn and others believe the work to have
  been written by Nicolas, the son of Sigurd Hranesön, who was slain by the
  Birkebeiners on the 8th of September, 1176. Their reasons for coming to
  this conclusion are given at full length in the work above quoted. <!--

  id="page336"></a>{336}</span></p>

  <p>The whole of the <i>Kongs-skugg-sio</i> is well worthy of being
  translated into English. It may, indeed, in many respects, be considered
  as the most remarkable work of the old northerns.</p>

  <p class="author">EDWARD CHARLTON.</p>

  <p>Newcastle-on-Tyne, Oct 7. 1850.</p>

  <p>If F.Q. will look into Halfdan Einersen's edition of
  <i>Kongs-skugg-sio</i>, Soröe, 1768, the first time it was printed, he
  will find in the editor's preliminary remarks all that is known of the
  date and origin of the work. The author is unknown, but that he was a
  Northman and lived in Nummedal, in Norway, and wrote somewhere between
  1140 and 1270, or, according to Finsen, about 1154; and that he had in
  his youth been a courtier, and afterwards a royal councillor, we infer
  from the internal evidence the work itself affords us.
  <i>Kongs-skugg-sio</i>, or the royal mirror, deserves to be better known,
  on account of the lively picture it gives us of the manners and customs
  of the North in the twelfth century; the state of the arts and the amount
  of science known to the educated. It abounds in sound morals, and its
  author might have sate at the feet of Adam Smith for the orthodoxy of his
  political economy. He is not entirely free from the credulity of his age
  and his account of Ireland will match anything to be found in Sir John
  Mandeville. Here we are told of an island on which nothing rots, of
  another on which nothing dies, of another on one-half of which devils
  alone reside, of wonderful monsters and animals, and of miracles the
  strangest ever wrought. He invents nothing. What he relates of Ireland he
  states to have found in books, or to have derived from hearsay. The
  following extract must therefore be taken as a specimen of Irish
  Folk-lore in the twelfth century:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"There is also one thing, he says, that will seem wonderful, and it
  happened in the town which is called Kloena [Cloyne]. In that town there
  is a church which is dedicated to the memory of a holy man called
  Kiranus. And there it happened one Sunday, as the people were at prayers
  and heard mass, that there descended gently from the air an anchor, as if
  it had been cast from a ship, for there was a cable to it, and the fluke
  of the anchor caught in the arch of the church-door, and all the people
  went out of church, and wondered, and looked up into the air after the
  cable. There they saw a ship floating above the cable, and men on board;
  and next they saw a man leap overboard, and dive down to the anchor to
  free it. He appeared, from the motions he made with both hands and feet,
  like a man swimming in the sea. And when he reached the anchor, he
  endeavoured to loosen it, when the people ran forwards to seize the man.
  But the church in which the anchor stuck fast had a bishop's chair in it.
  The bishop was present on this occasion, and forbade the people to hold
  the man, and said that he might be drowned just as if in water. And
  immediately he was set free he hastened up to the ship, and when he was
  on board, they hauled up the cable and disappeared from men's sight; but
  the anchor has since laid in the church as a testimony of this."</p>

<h3>GOLD IN CALIFORNIA.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 132.)</p>

  <p>E.N.W. refers to Shelvocke's voyage of 1719, in which reference is
  made to the abundance of gold in the soil of California. In Hakluyt's
  <i>Voyages</i>, printed in 1599-1600, will be found much earlier notices
  on this subject. California was first discovered in the time of the Great
  Marquis, as Cortes was usually called. There are accounts of these early
  expeditions by Francisco Vasquez Coronada, Ferdinando Alarchon, Father
  Marco de Niça, and Francisco de Ulloa, who visited the country in 1539
  and 1540. It is stated by Hakluyt that they were as far to the north as
  the 37th degree of latitude, which would be about one degree south of St.
  Francisco. I am inclined, however, to believe from the narrations
  themselves that the Spanish early discoveries did not extend much beyond
  the 34th degree of latitude, being little higher than the Peninsular or
  Lower California. In all these accounts, however, distinct mention is
  made of abundance of gold. In one of them it is stated that the natives
  used plates of gold to scrape the perspiration off their bodies!</p>

  <p>The most curious and distinct account, however, is that given in "The
  famous voyage of Sir Francis Drake into the South Sea, &amp;c. in 1577",
  which will be found in the third volume of Hakluyt, page 730., <i>et
  seq</i>. I am tempted to make some extracts from this, and the more so
  because a very feasible claim might be based upon the transaction in
  favour of our Sovereign Lady the Queen. At page 737. I find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The 5th day of June (1579) being in 43 degrees wards the pole
  Arctike, we found the ayre so colde, that our men being grievously
  pinched with the same, complained of the extremitie thereof, and the
  further we went, the more the colde increased upon us. Whereupon we
  thought it best for that time to seeke the land, and did so, finding it
  not mountainous, but low plaine land, till we came within thirty degrees
  toward the line. In which height it pleased God to send us into a faire
  and good baye, with a good winde to enter the same. In this baye wee
  anchored."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A glance at the map will show that "in this baye" is now situated the
  famous city of San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Their doings in the bay are then narrated, and from page 738. I
  extract the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"When they [the natives with their king] had satisfied themselves
  [with dancing, &amp;c.] they made signes to our General [Drake] to sit
  downe, to whom the king and divers others made several orations, or
  rather supplications, that hee would take their province or <!-- Page 337
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>{337}</span>
  kingdom into his hand, and become their king, making signes that they
  would resigne unto him their right and title of the whole land, and
  become his subjects. In which, to persuade us the better, the king and
  the rest with our consent, and with great reverence, joyfully singing a
  song, did set the crowne upon his head, inriched his necke with all their
  chaines, and offred unto him many other things, honouring him by the name
  of Hioh, adding thereulto, as it seemed, a sign of triumph; which thing
  our Generall thought not meet to reject, because he knew not what honour
  and profit it might be to our countrey. Whereupon, in the name and to the
  use of Her Majestie, he took the scepter, crowne, and dignitie of the
  said country into his hands, wishing that the riches and treasure thereof
  might so conveniently be transported to the inriching of her kingdom at
  home, as it aboundeth in y<sup>e</sup> same.</p>

  <p>"Our Generall called this countrey Nova Albion, and that for two
  causes; the one in respect of the white bankes and cliffes, which lie
  towards the sea, and the other, because it might have some affinities
  with our countrey in name, which sometime was so called."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then comes the curious statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<i>There is no part of earth heere to be taken up, wherein there is
  not some probable show of gold or silver.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The narrative then goes on to state that formal possession was taken
  of the country by putting up a "monument" with "a piece of sixpence of
  current English money under the plate," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Drake and the bold cavaliers of that day probably found that it paid
  better to rob the Spaniard of the gold and silver ready made in the shape
  of "the Acapulco galleon," or such like, than to sift the soil of the
  Sacramento for its precious grains. At all events, the wonderful richness
  of the "earth" seems to have been completely overlooked or forgotten. So
  little was it suspected, until the Americans acquired the country at the
  peace with Mexico, that in the fourth volume of Knight's <i>National
  Cyclopædia</i>, published early in 1848, in speaking of Upper California,
  it is said, "very little mineral wealth has been met with"! A few months
  after, intelligence reached Europe how much the reverse was the case.</p>

<h3>THE DISPUTED PASSAGE PROM THE TEMPEST.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., pp. 259. 299.)</p>

  <p>When the learning and experience of such gentlemen as MR. SINGER and
  MR. COLLIER fail to conclude a question, there is no higher appeal than
  to plain common sense, aided by the able arguments advanced on each side.
  Under these circumstances, perhaps you will allow one who is neither
  learned nor experienced to offer a word or two by way of vote on the
  meaning of the passage in the <i>Tempest</i> cited by MR. SINGER. It
  appears to me that to do full justice to the question the passage should
  be quoted entire, which, with your permission, I will do.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>Fer.</i> There be some sports are painful; and their labour</p>
      <p>Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness</p>
      <p>Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters</p>
      <p>Point to rich ends. This, my mean task</p>
      <p>Would be as heavy to me as odious, but</p>
      <p>The mistress, which I serve, quickens what's dead</p>
      <p>And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is</p>
      <p>Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,</p>
      <p>And he's compos'd of harshness. I must remove</p>
      <p>Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up</p>
      <p>Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress</p>
      <p>Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness</p>
      <p>Had ne'er like executor. <i>I forget</i>;</p>
      <p><i>But</i> these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labour(s),</p>
      <p>Most busy(l)est when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The question appears to be whether "most busy" applies to "sweet
  thoughts" or to Ferdinand, and whether the pronoun "it" refers to the act
  of <i>forgetting</i> or to "labour(s);" and I must confess that, to me,
  the whole significancy of the passage depends upon the idea conveyed of
  the mind being "most busy" while the body is being exerted. Every man
  with a spark of imagination must many a time have felt this. In the most
  essential particular, therefore, I think MR. SINGER is right in his
  correction but at the same time agreeing with MR. COLLIER, that it is
  desirable not to interfere with the original text further than is
  absolutely necessary, I think the substitution of "labour" for "labours"
  is of questionable expediency. What is the use of the conjunction "but"
  if not to connect the excuse for the act of forgetting with the act
  itself?</p>

  <p>Without intending to follow MR. COLLIER through the course of his
  argument, I should like to notice one or two points. The usage of
  Shakspeare's day admitted many variations from the stricter grammatical
  rules of our own; but no usage ever admitted such a sentence as
  this,&mdash;for though elliptically expressed, MR. COLLIER treats it as a
  sentence,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Most busy, least when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is neither grammar nor sense: and I persist in believing that
  Shakspeare was able to construct an intelligible sentence according to
  rules as much recognised by custom then as now.</p>

  <p>But, indeed, does not MR. COLLIER virtually admit that the text is
  inexplicable in his very attempt to explain it? He sums up by saying
  "that in fact, his toil is no toil, and that when he is 'most busy' he
  'least does it,'" which is precisely the reverse of what the text says,
  if it express any meaning at all. I will agree with him in preferring the
  old text to any other text where it gives a perfect meaning; but to
  prefer it here, when the omission of a single letter produces an image at
  once <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"
  id="page338"></a>{338}</span> noble and complete, would, to my mind,
  savour more of superstition than true worship.</p>

  <p>P.S. It should be observed that MR. COLLIER'S "least" is as much of an
  alteration of the original text as MR. SINGER'S "busyest", the one adding
  and the other omittng a letter. The folio of 1632, where it differs front
  the first folio, will hardly add to the authority of MR. COLLIER
  himself.</p>

  <p class="author">SAMUEL HICKSON.</p>

  <p>Oct. 10. 1850.</p>

  <p>If one, who is but a charmed listener to Shakspeare, may presume to
  offer an opinion to practised interpreters, I should suggest to MR.
  SINGER and MR. COLLIER, another and a totally different reading of the
  passage in discussion by them from the exquisite opening scene of the 3d
  Act of the <i>Tempest</i>.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that "most busy" applies more poetically to
  <i>thoughts</i> than to <i>labours</i>; and, in so much, MR. SINGER'S
  reading is to be commended. But it is equally true that, by adhering to
  the early text, MR. COLLIER'S school of editing has restored force and
  beauty to many passages which had previously been outraged by fancied
  improvements, so that his unflinching support of the original word in
  this instance is also to be respected. But may not both be combined? I
  think they may, by understanding the passage in question as though a
  transposition had taken place between the words "least" and "when".</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Most busy <i>when least</i> I do it,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>or,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Most busy when least employed."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>forming just the sort of verbal antithesis of which the poet was so
  fond.</p>

  <p>An actual transposition of the words may have taken place through the
  fault of the early printers; but even if the <i>present order</i> be
  preserved, still the <i>transposed sense</i> is, I think, much less
  difficult than the forced and rather contradictory meaning contended for
  by MR. COLLIER. Has not <i>the pause</i> in Ferdinand's labour been
  hitherto too much overlooked? What is it that has induced him to
  <i>forget</i> his task? Is it not those delicious thoughts, most busy in
  the <i>pauses</i> of labour, making those pauses still more refreshing
  and renovating?</p>

  <p>Ferdinand says&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"I forget,"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and then he adds, <i>by way of excuse</i>,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>But</i> the sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,</p>
      <p>Most busy when least I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>More busy in thought when idle, than in labour when employed. The
  cessation from labour was favourable to the thoughts that made it
  endurable.</p>

  <p>Malone quarrelled with the word "but", for which he would have
  substituted "and" or "for". But in the <i>apologetic</i> sense which I
  would confer upon the last two lines of Ferdinand's speech, the word
  "but", at their commencement, becomes not only appropriate but
  necessary.</p>

<h3>"LONDON BRIDGE IS BROKEN DOWN."</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 258.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent T.S.D. does not remember to have seen that
  interesting old nursery ditty "London Bridge is broken down" printed, or
  even referred to in print. For the edification then of all interested in
  the subject, I send you the following.</p>

  <p>The old song on "London Bridge" is printed in Ritson's <i>Gammer
  Gurton's Garland</i>, and in Halliwell's <i>Nursery Rhymes of
  England</i>; but both copies are very imperfect. There are also some
  fragments preserved in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for September,
  1823 (vol. xciii. p. 232.), and in the <i>Mirror</i> for November 1st of
  the same year. From these versions a tolerably perfect copy has been
  formed, and printed in a little work, for which I am answerable, entitled
  <i>Nursery Rhymes, with the Tunes to which they are still sung in the
  Nurseries of England</i>. But the whole ballad has probably been formed
  by many fresh additions in a long series of years, and is, perhaps,
  almost interminable when received in all its different versions.</p>

  <p>The correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> remarks, that
  "London Bridge is broken down" is an old ballad which, more than seventy
  years previous, he had heard plaintively warbled by a lady who was born
  in the reign of Charles II., and who lived till nearly that of George II.
  Another correspondent to the same magazine, whose contribution, signed
  "D.," is inserted in the same volume (December, p. 507.), observes, that
  the ballad concerning London Bridge formed, in his remembrance, part of a
  Christmas carol, and commenced thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Dame, get up and bake your pies,</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day in the morning."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The requisition, he continues, goes on to the dame to prepare for the
  feast, and her answer is&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"London Bridge is broken down,</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day in the morning."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The inference always was, that until the bridge was rebuilt some stop
  would be put to the dame's Christmas operations; but why the falling of a
  part of London Bridge should form part of a Christmas carol it is
  difficult to determine.</p>

  <p>A Bristol correspondent, whose communication is inserted in that
  delightful volume the <i>Chronicles of London Bridge</i> (by Richard
  Thomson, of the London Institution), says,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"About forty years ago, one moonlight night, in a street in Bristol,
  his attention was attracted by dance <!-- Page 339 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>{339}</span> and
  chorus of boys and girls, to which the words of this ballad gave measure.
  The breaking down of the bridge was announced as the dancers moved round
  in a circle, hand in hand; and the question, 'How shall we build it up
  again?' was chanted by the leader, whilst the rest stood still."</p>

  <p>Concerning the antiquity of this ballad, a modern writer
  remarks,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"If one might hazard a conjecture concerning it, we should refer its
  composition to some very ancient date, when, London Bridge lying in
  ruins, the office of bridge master was vacant, and his power over the
  river Lea (for it is doubtless that river which is celebrated in the
  chorus to this song) was for a while at an end. But this, although the
  words and melody of the verses are extremely simple, is all
  uncertain."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If I might hazard another conjecture, I would refer it to the period
  when London Bridge was the scene of a terrible contest between the Danes
  and Olave of Norway. There is an animated description of this "Battle of
  London Bridge," which gave ample theme to the Scandinavian scalds, in
  <i>Snorro Sturleson</i>; and, singularly enough, the first line is the
  same as that of our ditty:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"London Bridge is broken down;</p>
      <p>Gold is won and bright renown;</p>
      <p class="i4">Shields resounding,</p>
      <p class="i4">War horns sounding,</p>
      <p>Hildur shouting in the din;</p>
      <p class="i4">Arrows singing,</p>
      <p class="i4">Mail-coats ringing,</p>
      <p>Odin makes our Olaf win."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>See Laing's <i>Heimskringla</i>, vol. ii. p. 10.; and Bulwer's
  <i>Harold</i>, vol. i. p. 59. The last-named work contains, in the notes,
  some excellent remarks upon the poetry of the Danes, and its great
  influence upon our early national muse.</p>

  <p class="author">EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[T.S.D.'s inquiry respecting this once popular nursery song has
  brought us a host of communications; but none which contain the precise
  information upon the subject which is to be found in DR. RIMBAULT's
  reply. TOBY, who kindly forwards the air to which it was sung, speaks of
  it as a "'lullaby song,' well-known in the southern part of Kent and in
  Lincolnshire."</p>

  <p>E.N.W. says it is printed in the collection of <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>
  published by Burns, and that he was born and bred in London, and that it
  was one of the nursery songs he was amused with. NOCAB ET AMICUS, two old
  fellows of the Society of Antiquaries, do not doubt that it refers to
  some event preserved in history, especially, they add, as we have a faint
  recollection "of a note, touching such an event, in an almost used-up
  English history, which was read in our nursery by an elder brother,
  something less than three-fourths of a century since. And we have also a
  shrewd suspicion that the sequel of the song has reference to the
  reconstruction of that fabric at a later date."</p>

  <p>J.S.C. has sent us a copy of the song; and we are indebted for another
  copy to AN ENGLISH MOTHER, who has accompanied it with notices of some
  other popular songs, notices which at some future opportunity we shall
  lay before our readers.&mdash;ED.]</p>

<h3>ARABIC NUMERALS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., pp. 27. 61.)</p>

  <p>I must apologise for adding anything to the already abundant articles
  which have from time to time appeared in "NOTES AND QUERIES" on this
  interesting subject; I shall therefore confine myself to a few brief
  remarks on the <i>form</i> of each character, and, if possible, to show
  from what alphabets they are derived:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. This most natural form of the first numeral is the first character
  in the Indian, Arabic, Syriac, and Roman systems.</p>

  <p>2. This appears to be formed from the Hebrew <span lang="he" title="b"
  >&#x5D1;</span>, which, in the Syriac, assumes nearly the form of our 2;
  the Indian character is identical, but arranged vertically instead of
  horizontally.</p>

  <p>3. This is clearly derived from the Indian and Arabic forms, the
  position being altered, and the vertical stroke omitted.</p>

  <p>4. This character is found as the fourth letter in the Ph&#339;nician
  and ancient Hebrew alphabets: the Indian is not very dissimilar.</p>

  <p>5. and 6. These bear a great resemblance to the Syriac Heth and Vau (a
  hook). When erected, the Estrangelo-Syriac Vau is precisely the form of
  our 6.</p>

  <p>7. This figure is derived from the Hebrew <span lang="he" title="z"
  >&#x5D6;</span>, zayin, which in the Estrangelo-Syriac is merely a 7
  reversed.</p>

  <p>8. This figure is merely a rounded form of the Samaritan Kheth (a
  travelling scrip, with a string tied round thus, <img
  src="images/019a.png" alt="Samaritan Character" />). The
  Estrangelo-Syriac <img src="images/019b.png" alt="Estrangelo-Syriac
  Character" /> also much resembles it.</p>

  <p>9. Identical with the Indian and Arabic.</p>

  <p>0. Nothing; vacuity. It probably means the orb or <i>boundary</i> of
  the earth.&mdash;10. is the first boundary, <span lang="he" title="tchwm"
  >&#x5EA;&#x5D7;&#x5D5;&#x5DD;</span>, Tekum, <span lang="el" title="Deka"
  >&#x394;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;</span>, Decem, "terminus." Something more
  yet remains to be said, I think, on the <i>names</i> of the letters. Cf.
  "Table of Alphabets" in Gesenius, <i>Lex</i>., ed. Tregelles, and "NOTES
  AND QUERIES," Vol. i., p. 434.</p>

  <p class="author">E. S. T.</p>

  <p><i>Arabic Numerals.</i>&mdash;With regard to the subject of Arabic
  numerals, and the instance at Castleacre (Vol. ii., pp. 27. 61.), I think
  I may safely say that no archæologist of the present day would allow,
  after seeing the original, that it was of the date 1084, even if it were
  not so certain that these numerals were not in use at that time. I fear
  "the acumen of Dr. Murray" was wasted on the occasion referred to in Mr.
  Bloom's work. It is a very far-fetched idea, that the visitor must cross
  himself to discover the meaning of the figures; not to mention the
  inconvenience, I might say impossibility, <!-- Page 340 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>{340}</span> of
  reading them after he had turned his back upon them,&mdash;the position
  required to bring them into the order 1084. It is also extremely
  improbable that so obscure a part of the building should be chosen for
  erecting the date of the foundation; nor is it likely that so important a
  record would be merely impressed on the plaister, liable to destruction
  at any time. Read in the most natural way, it makes 1480: but I much
  doubt its being a date at all. The upper figure resembles a Roman I; and
  this, with the O beneath, may have been a mason's initials at some time
  when the plaister was renewed: for that the figures are at least sixty
  years later than the supposed date, Mr. Bloom confesses, the church not
  having been built until then.</p>

<h3>CAXTON'S PRINTING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., pp. 99. 122. 142. 187. 233.)</p>

  <p>I confess, after having read MR. J.G. NICHOLS' critique in a recent
  number of the "NOTES AND QUERIES," relative to the locality of the first
  printing-press erected by Caxton in this country, I am not yet convinced
  that it was not within the Abbey of Westminster. From MR. NICHOLS' own
  statements, I find that Caxton himself says his books were "imprynted" by
  him in the Abbey; to this, however, MR. NICHOLS replies by way of
  objection, "that Caxton does not say in the church of the Abbey."</p>

  <p>On the above words of Caxton "in the Abbey of Westminster," Mr. C.
  Knight, in his excellent biography of the old printer, observes, "they
  leave no doubt that beneath the actual roof of some portion of the Abbey
  he carried on his art." Stow says "that Caxton was the first that carried
  on his art in the Abbey." Dugdale, in his <i>Monasticon</i>, speaking of
  Caxton, says, "he erected his office in one of the side chapels of the
  Abbey." MR. NICHOLS, quoting from Stow, also informs us that
  printing-presses were, soon after the introduction of the art, erected in
  the Abbey of St. Albans, St. Augustin at Canterbury, and other
  monasteries; he also informs us that the scriptorium of the monasteries
  had ever been the manufactory of books, and these places it is well known
  formed a portion of the abbeys themselves, and were not in detached
  buildings similar to the Almonry at Westminster, which was situated some
  two or three hundred yards distant from the Abbey. I think it very
  likely, when the press was to supersede the pen in the work of
  book-making, that its capabilities would be first tried in the very place
  which had been used for the object it was designed to accomplish. This
  idea seems to be confirmed by the tradition that a printer's office has
  ever been called a chapel, a fact which is beautifully alluded to by Mr.
  Creevy in his poem entitled <i>The Press</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Yet stands the chapel in yon Gothic shrine,</p>
      <p>Where wrought the father of our English line,</p>
      <p>Our art was hail'd from kingdoms far abroad,</p>
      <p>And cherish'd in the hallow'd house of God;</p>
      <p>From which we learn the homage it received</p>
      <p>And how our sires its heavenly birth believed.</p>
      <p>Each printer hence, howe'er unblest his walls,</p>
      <p>E'en to this day, his house a chapel calls."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. Nichols acknowledges that what he calls a vulgar error was current
  and popular, that in some part of the Abbey Caxton did erect his press,
  yet we are expected to submit to the almost unsupported dictum of that
  gentleman, and renounce altogether the old and almost universal idea.
  With respect to his alarm that the <i>vulgar error</i> is about to be
  further propagated by an engraving, wherein the mistaken draftsman has
  deliberately represented the printers at work within the consecrated
  walls of the church itself, I may be permitted to say, on behalf of the
  painter, that he has erected his press not even on the basement of one of
  the Abbey chapels, but in an upper story, a beautiful screen separating
  the workplace from the more sacred part of the building.</p>

<h3>COLD HARBOUR.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. i., p. 60.; Vol. ii., p. 159.)</p>

  <p>I beg leave to inform you that Yorkshire has its "Cold Harbour," and
  for the origin of the term, I subjoin a communication sent me by my
  father:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When a youngster, I was a great seeker for etymologies. A solitary
  farm-house and demesne were pointed out to me, the locality of which was
  termed C&#259;d, or C&#365;dh&#257;ber, or C&#365;dh&#257;rber.
  Conjectures, near akin to those now presented, occurred to me. I was
  invited to inspect the locality. I dined with the old yeoman (aged about
  eighty) who occupied the farm. He gave me the etymology. In his earlier
  days he had come to this farm; a house was not built, yet he was
  compelled by circumstances to bring over part of his farming implements,
  &amp;c. He, with his men-servants, had no other shelter at the time than
  a dilapidated barn. When they assembled to eat their cold provisions, the
  farmer cried out, 'Hegh lads, but there's cauld (or caud) harbour here.'
  The spot had no name previously. The rustics were amused by the farmer's
  saying. Hence the locality was termed by them Cold Harbour, corrupted,
  C&#259;dh&#257;rber, and the etymon remains to this day. This information
  put an end to my enquiries about Cold Harbour."</p>

  <p class="author">C.M.J.</p>

  <p><i>Cold Harbour.</i>&mdash;The goldfinches which have remained among
  the valleys of the Brighton Downs during the winter are called, says Mr.
  <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341"
  id="page341"></a>{341}</span> Knox, by the catchers, "harbour birds,
  meaning that they have sojourned or harboured, as the local expression
  is, here during the season." Does not this, with the fact of a place in
  Pembroke being called Cold Blow, added to the many places with the prefix
  Cold, tend to confirm the supposition that the numerous cold harbours
  were places of protection against the winter winds?</p>

  <p class="author">A.C.</p>

  <p>With regard to Cold Harbour (supposed "Coluber," which is by no means
  satisfactory), it may be worth observing that Cold is a common prefix:
  thus there is Cold Ashton, Cold Coats, Cold or Little Higham, Cold
  Norton, Cold Overton, Cold Waltham, Cold St. Aldwins, &mdash;coats,
  &mdash;meere, &mdash;well, &mdash;stream, and several <i>cole</i>,
  &amp;c. Cold peak is a hill near Kendall. The latter suggests to me a
  <i>Query</i> to genealogists. Was the old baronial name of Peche, Pecche,
  of Norman origin as in the Battle Roll? From the fact of the Peak of
  Derby having been Pech-e <i>antè</i> 1200, I think this surname must have
  been local, though it soon became soft, as appears from the rebus of the
  Lullingstone family, a peach with the letter é on it. I do not think that
  <i>k</i> is formed to similar words in Domesday record.</p>

  <p>Caldecote, a name of several places, may require explanation.</p>

  <p class="author">AUG. CAMB.</p>

  <p>I beg to give you the localities of two "Cold Harbours:" one on the
  road from Uxbridge to Amersham, 19½ miles from London (see Ordnance Map
  7.); the other on the road from Chelmsford to Epping, 13½ miles from the
  former place (see Ordnance Map No. 1. N.W.).</p>

  <p class="author">DISS.</p>

  <p>There are several Cold Harbours in Sussex, in Dallington, Chiddingly,
  Wivelsfield, one or two in Worth, one S.W. of Bignor, one N.E. of Hurst
  Green, and there may be more.</p>

  <p>In Surrey there is one in the parish of Bletchingley.</p>

  <p class="author">WILLIAM FIGG.</p>

  <p>There is a farm called Cold Harbour, near St. Albans, Herts.</p>

  <p class="author">S.A.</p>

  <p>After the numerous and almost tedious theories concerning Cold
  Harbours, particularly the "forlorn hope" of the <i>Coal Depôts</i> in
  London and elsewhere, permit me to suggest one of almost universal
  application. Respecting <i>here-burh</i>, an inland station for an army,
  in the same sense as a "harbour" for ships on the sea-coast, a word still
  sufficiently familiar and intelligible, the question seems to be settled;
  and the French "auberge" for an inn has been used as an illustration,
  though the first syllable may be doubtful. The principal difficulty
  appears to consist in the prefix "Cold;" for why, it may be asked, should
  a bleak and "cold" situation be selected as a "harbour"? The fact
  probably is that this spelling, however common, is a corruption for
  "COL.". Colerna, in Wiltshire, fortunately retains the original
  orthography, and in Anglo-Saxon literally signifies the habitation or
  settlement of a colony; though in some topographical works we are told
  that it was formerly written "Cold Horne," and that it derives its name
  from its bleak situation. This, however, is a mere coincidence; for some
  of these harbours are in warm sheltered situations. Sir R.C. Hoare was
  right when he observed, that these "harbours" were generally near some
  Roman road or Roman settlement. It is therefore wonderful that it should
  not at once occur to every one conversant with the Roman occupation of
  this island, that all these "COL-harbours" mark the settlements, farms,
  outposts, or garrisons of the Roman colonies planted here.</p>

  <p class="author">J.I.</p>

  <p>Oxford.</p>

  <p><i>Cold Harbour.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent asks whether there is a
  "Cold Harbour" in every county, &amp;c. I think it probable, though it
  may take some time to catalogue them all. There are so many in some
  counties, that ten on an average for each would in all likelihood fall
  infinitely short of the number. The Roman colonists must have formed
  settlements in all directions during their long occupation of so
  favourite a spot as Britain. "Cold Harbour Farm" is a very frequent
  denomination of insulated spots cultivated from time immemorial. These
  are not always found in <i>cold</i> situations. Nothing is more common
  than to add a final <i>d</i>, unnecessarily, to a word or syllable,
  particularly in compound words. Instances will occur to every reader,
  which it would be tedious to enumerate.</p>

  <p class="author">J.I.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After reading the foregoing communications on the subject of the
  much-disputed etymology of COLD HARBOUR, our readers will probably agree
  with us in thinking the following note, from a very distinguished Saxon
  scholar, offers a most satisfactory solution of the question:&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With reference to the note of G.B.H. (Vol. i, p. 60.) as well as to
  the very elaborate letter in the "Proceedings of the Society of
  Antiquaries" (the paper in the <i>Archæologia</i> I have not seen), I
  would humbly suggest the possibility, that the word <i>Cold</i> or
  <i>Cole</i> may originally have been the Anglo-Saxon C&#333;l, and the
  entire expression have designated <i>a cool summer residence</i> by a
  river's side or on an eminence; such localities, in short, as are
  described in the "Proceedings" as bearing the name of Cold Harbour.</p>

  <p>The denomination appears to me evidently the modern English for the
  A.-S. C&#333;l Hereberg. Colburn, Colebrook, Coldstream, are, no doubt,
  analagous denominations.</p>

<h3>ST. UNCUMBER.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 286.)</p>

  <p>PWCCA, after quoting from Michael Wodde's <i>Dialogue or Familiar
  Talke</i> the passage in which he says, "If a wife were weary of her
  husband <i>she offred otes at Paules</i> in London to St. Uncumber," asks
  "who St. Uncumber was?"</p>

  <p>St. Uncumber was one of those popular saints whose names are not to be
  found in any calendar, and whose histories are now only to be learned
  from the occasional allusions to them to be met with in our early
  writers,&mdash;allusions which it is most desirable should be recorded in
  "NOTES AND QUERIES." The following cases, in which mention is made of
  this saint, are therefore noted, although they do not throw much light on
  the history of St. Uncumber.</p>

  <p>The first is from Harsenet's <i>Discoverie, &amp;c.</i>, p.l34.:</p>

  <p>"And the commending himselfe to the tuition of S. Uncumber, or els our
  blessed Lady."</p>

  <p>The second is from Bale's <i>Interlude concerning the Three Laws of
  Nature, Moses, and Christ</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"If ye cannot slepe, but slumber,</p>
      <p>Geve <i>Otes</i> unto Saynt Uncumber,</p>
      <p>And Beanes in a certen number</p>
      <p class="i2">Unto Saynt Blase and Saynt Blythe."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I will take an early opportunity of noting some similar allusions to
  Sir John Shorne, St. Withold, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>HANDFASTING.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 282.)</p>

  <p>JARLTZBRG, in noticing this custom, says that the Jews seem to have
  had a similar one, which perhaps they borrowed from the neighbouring
  nations; at least the connexion formed by the prophet Hosea (chap. iii.,
  v. 2.) bears strong resemblance to <i>Handfasting</i>. The 3rd verse in
  Hosea, as well as the 2nd, should I think be referred to. They are both
  as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer
  of barley, and an half homer of barley: and I said unto her, Thou shalt
  abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt
  not be for another man; so will I also be for thee."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now by consulting our most learned commentators upon the meaning which
  they put upon these two verses in connexion with each other, I cannot
  think that the analogy of JARLTZBERG will be found correct. In allusion
  to verse 2, "so I bought her," &amp;c., Bishop Horsley says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This was not a payment in the shape of a dowry; for the woman was his
  property, if he thought fit to claim her, <i>by virtue of the marriage
  already had</i>; but it was a present supply of her necessary wants, by
  which he acknowledged her as his wife, and engaged to furnish her with
  alimony, not ample indeed, but suitable to the recluse life which he
  prescribed to her."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And in allusion, in verse 3., to the words "Thou shall abide for me
  many days," Dr. Pocock thus explains the context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"That is, thou shalt stay sequestered, and as in a state of widowhood,
  till the time come that I shall be fully reconciled to thee, and shall
  see fit again to receive thee to the privileges of a wife."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Both commentators are here evidently alluding to what occurs after a
  marriage has actually taken place. Handfasting takes place before a
  marriage is consummated.</p>

  <p>A chapter upon marriage contracts and ceremonies would form an
  important and amusing piece of history. I have not Picart's <i>Religious
  Ceremonies</i> at hand, but if I mistake not he refers to many. In Marco
  Polo's <i>Travels</i>, I find the following singular, and to a Christian
  mind disgusting, custom. It is related in section l9.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"These twenty days journey ended, having passed over the province of
  Thibet, we met with cities and many villages, in which, through the
  blindness of idolatry, a wicked custom is used; for no man there marrieth
  a wife that is a virgin; whereupon, when travellers and strangers, coming
  from other places, pass through this country and pitch their pavilions,
  the women of that place having marriageable daughters, bring them unto
  strangers, desiring them to take them and enjoy their company as long as
  they remain there. Thus the handsomest are chosen, and the rest return
  home sorrowful, and when they depart, they are not suffered to carry any
  away with them, but faithfully restore them to their parents. The maiden
  also requireth some toy or small present of him who hath deflowered her,
  which she may show as an argument and proof of her condition; and she
  that hath been loved and abused of most men, and shall have many such
  favours and toys to show to her wooers, is accounted more noble, and may
  on that account be advantageously married; and when she would appear most
  honourably dressed, she hangs all her lovers' favours about her neck, and
  the more acceptable she was to many, so much the more honour she receives
  from her countrymen. But when they are once married, they are no more
  suffered to converse with strange men, and men of this country are very
  cautious never to offend one another in this matter."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">J.M.G.</p>

  <p>Worcester, Oct. 1850.</p>

  <p>The curious subject brought forward by J.M.G. under this title, and
  enlarged upon by JARLTZBERG (Vol. ii., p. 282.), leads me to trouble you
  with this in addition. Elizabeth Mure, according to the <i>History and
  Descent of the House of Rowallane</i> by Sir William Mure, was made
  choyce of, for her excellent beautie and rare virtues, by King Robert
  II., to be Queen of Scotland; and if their union may be considered to
  illustrate in any way the singular custom of <i>Handfasting</i>, it will
  be seen <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343"
  id="page343"></a>{343}</span> from the following extract that they were
  also married by a priest:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Mr. Johne Lermonth, chapline to Alexander Archbishop of St. Andrews,
  hath left upon record in a deduction of the descent of the House of
  Rowallane collected by him at the command of the said Archbishop (whose
  interest in the familie is to be spoken of heirafter), that Robert, Great
  Stewart of Scotland, having taken away the said Elizabeth Mure, drew to
  Sir Adam her father ane instrument that he should take her to his lawful
  wife, (which myself hath seen saith the collector), as also ane
  testimonie written in latine by Roger Mc Adame, priest of our Ladie
  Marie's chapel (in Kyle), that the said Roger maried Robert and Elizabeth
  for<sup>sds</sup>. But y<sup>r</sup>after durring the great troubles in
  the reign of King David Bruce, to whom the Earl of Rosse continued long a
  great enemie, at perswasion of some of the great ones of the time, the
  Bishop of Glasgow, William Rae by name, gave way that the s<sup>d</sup>
  marriage should be abrogate by transaction, which both the chief
  instrument, the Lord Duglasse, the Bishope, and in all likelihood the
  Great Stewart himself, repented ever hereafter. The Lord Yester
  Snawdoune, named Gifford, got to wife the s<sup>d</sup> Elizabeth, and
  the Earl of Rosse's daughter was maried to the Great Stewart, which Lord
  Yester and Eupheme, daughter to the Earle of Rosse, departing near to one
  time, the Great Stewart, being then king, openly acknowledged the first
  mariage, and invited home Elizabeth Mure to his lawfull bed, whose
  children shortlie y<sup>r</sup>after the nobility did sweare in
  parliament to maintaine in the right of succession to the croune as the
  only lawfull heirs y<sup>r</sup>of."</p>

  <p>"In these harder times shee bare to him Robert (named Johne
  Fairneyear), after Earle of Carrick, who succeeded to the croune; Robert,
  after Earl of Fyffe and Maneteeth, and Governour; and Alexander, after
  Earle of Buchane, Lord Badyenoch; and daughters, the eldest maried to
  Johne Dumbar, brother to the Earl of March, after Earle of Murray, and
  the second to Johne the Whyt Lyon, progenitor of the House of Glames, now
  Earle of Kinghorn."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So much for the marriage of Elizabeth Mure, as given by the historian
  of the House of Rowallane. Can any of your readers inform me whether
  Elizabeth had any issue by her second husband, Lord Yester Snawdoune? If
  so, there would be a relationship between Queen Victoria and the Hays,
  Marquesses of Tweeddale, and the Brouns, Baronets of Colstoun. One of the
  latter family received as a dowry with a daughter of one of the Lords
  Yester the celebrated WARLOCK PEAR, said to have been enchanted by the
  necromancer Hugo de Gifford, who died in 1267, and which is now nearly
  six centuries old. In the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>, James Fitz-James is
  styled by Scott "Snawdon's knight;" but why or wherefore does not appear,
  unless Queen Elizabeth Mure had issue by Gifford. Robert II. was one of
  three Scottish kings in succession who married the daughters of their own
  subjects, and those only of the degree of knights; namely, David Bruce,
  who married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Loggie; Robert II., who
  married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Adam Mure; and Robert III., who
  married Annabell, daughter to Sir John Drummond of Stobhall.</p>

<h3>GRAY'S ELEGY.&mdash;DRONING.&mdash;DODSLEY'S POEMS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., pp. 264. 301.)</p>

  <p>I only recur to the subject of Gray's Elegy to remark, that although
  your correspondents, A HERMIT AT HAMPSTEAD, and W.S., have given me a
  good deal of information, for which I thank them, they have not answered
  either of my Queries.</p>

  <p>I never doubted as to the true reading of the third line of the second
  stanza of Gray's Elegy, but merely remarked that in one place the
  penultimate word was printed <i>drony</i>, and other authorities
  <i>droning</i>. With reference to this point, what I wanted to know was
  merely, whether, in any good annotated edition of the poem, it had been
  stated that when Dodsley printed it in his <i>Collection of Poems</i>,
  1755, vol. iv., the epithet applied to flight was <i>drony</i>, and not
  <i>droning</i>? I dare say the point has not escaped notice; but if it
  have, the fact is just worth observation.</p>

  <p>Next, any doubt is not at all cleared up respecting the date of
  publication of Dodsley's Collection. The Rev. J. Mitford, in his Aldine
  edition of Gray, says (p. xxxiii.) that the first three volumes came out
  in 1752, whereas my copy of "the <i>second edition</i>" bears the date of
  1748. Is that the true date, or do editions vary? If the second edition
  came out in 1748, what was the date of the first edition? I only put this
  last question because, as most people are aware, some poems of note
  originally appeared in Dodsley's <i>Collection of Poems</i>, and it is
  material to ascertain the real year when they first came from the
  press.</p>

  action of a pin striking against it. It is one of the worst of many
  methods of loading at the breach; and the same principle was patented in
  England by A.A. Moser, a German, more than ten years ago. <!-- Page 344

  <p>It has already received the attention of our Ordnance department, and
  has been tried at Woolwich. The letter to which JARTZBERG refers, dated
  Berlin, Sept. 11., merely shows the extreme ignorance of the writer on
  such subjects, as the range he mentions has nothing whatever to do with
  the principle or mechanism of the gun in question. He ought also, before
  he expressed himself so strongly, to have known, that the extreme range
  of an English percussion musket is nearer <i>one mile</i> than <i>150
  yards</i> (which latter distance, he says, they do not exceed) and he
  would not have been so astonished at the range of the Zündnadel guns
  being 800 yards, if he had seen, as I have, a plain English two-grooved
  rifle range 1200 yards, with a proper elevation for the distance, and a
  conical projectile instead of a ball.</p>

  <p>The form and weight of the projectile fired from rifle, at a
  considerable elevation, say 25º to 30º, with sufficient charge of
  gunpowder, is the cause of the range and of the accuracy, and has nothing
  whatever to do with the construction or means by which it is fired,
  whether flint or percussion. The discussion of this subject is probably
  unsuited to your publication, or I could have considerably enlarged this
  communication. I will, however, simply add, that the Zündnadel is very
  liable to get out of order, much exposed to wet, and that it does not in
  reality possess any of the wonderful advantages that have been ascribed
  to it, except a facility of loading, <i>while clean</i>, which is more
  than counterbalanced by its defects.</p>

  <p><i>Thomson of Esholt</i> (Vol. ii., p. 268.).&mdash;Dr. Whitaker tells
  us (Ducatus, ii. 202.) that the dissolved priory of Essheholt was, in the
  1st Edw. VI., granted to Henry Thompson, Gent., one of the king's <i>gens
  d'armes</i> at Bologne. About a century afterwards the estate passed to
  the more ancient and distinguished Yorkshire family of Calverley, by the
  marriage of the daughter and heir of Henry Thompson, Esq., with Sir
  Walter Calverley. If your correspondent JAYTEE consult Sims's useful
  <i>Index to the Pedigrees and Arms contained in the Genealogical MSS. in
  the British Museum</i>, he will be referred to several pedigrees of the
  family of Thomson of Esholt. Of numerous respectable families of the name
  of Thompson seated in the neighbourhood of York, the common ancestor
  seems to have been a James Thompson of Thornton in Pickering Lythe, who
  flourished in the reign of Elizabeth. (Vice Poulson's <i>Holderess</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 63.) All these families bear the arms described by your
  correspondent, but <i>without</i> the bend sinister. The crest they use
  is also nearly the same, viz., an armed arm, embowed, grasping a broken
  tilting spear.</p>

  <p>No general collection of Yorkshire genealogies has been published.
  Information as to the pedigrees of Yorkshire families must be sought for
  in the well-known topographical works of Thoresby Whitaker, Hunter,
  &amp;c., or in the MS. collections of Torre, Hopkinson, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Monasticon Eboracense</i>, by John Burton M.D., fol., York,
  1778, under the head of "Eschewolde, Essold, Esscholt, or Esholt, in
  Ayredale in the Deanry of the Ainsty," at pp. 139. and 140., your
  correspondent JAYTEE will find that the site of this priory was granted,
  1 Edward VI., 1547, to Henry Thompson, one of the king's <i>gens
  d'armes</i>, at Boleyn; who, by Helen, daughter of Laurence Townley, had
  a natural son called William, living in 1585 who, assuming his father's
  surname, and marrying Dorothy, daughter of Christopher Anderson of
  Lostock in com. Lanc. prothonotary became the ancestor of those families
  of the Thompsons now living in and near York. He may see also Burke's
  <i>Landed Gentry</i>, article "Say of Tilney, co. Norfolk," in the

  Upon looking into the passage referred to, I remembered the following
  observation by a learned writer now living, which will doubtless guide
  your correspondent to the author intended:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"On the subject of the imperfect views concerning the Deity,
  entertained by the ancient philosophical sects, I would especially refer
  to that most able and elaborate investigation of them, Meiner's very
  interesting tract, <i>De Vero Deo.</i>"&mdash;(An Elementary Course of
  Theological Lectures, delivered in Bristol College, 1831-1833, by the
  Rev. W.D. Conybeare, now the Very Rev. the Dean of Llandaff. )</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A.N. will not be surprised at Cusa Using the term "antiquitates"
  instead of "De Vero Deo," if he will compare his expressions on the same
  subject in his book <i>De Venatione Sapientiæ</i>, e.g.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Vides nunc æternum illud <i>antiquissimum</i> in eo campo (scilicet
  non aliud) dulcissima venatione quæri posse. Attingis enim

  some monasteries did answer them to the Pope, and did therefore collect
  the tax, that in process of time became, as by custom, paid to that house
  which being after derived to the crown, and from thence, by grant, to
  others, with as ample <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><i>Smoke Money</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 120, 269.).&mdash;I do not know
  whether any additional information on <i>smoke money</i> is required but
  the following extracts may be interesting to your Querist:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"At this daie the Bp. of Elie hath out of everie parish in
  Cambridgeshire a certeine tribute called Elie Farthings, or <i>Smoke
  Farthings</i>, which the church-wardens do levie, according to the number
  of houses or else of chimneys that be in a parish."&mdash;MSS, Baker,
  xxix. 326.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The date of this impost is given in the next extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"By the records of the Church of Elie, it appears that in the year
  1154, every person who kept a fire in the several parishes within that
  diocese was obliged to pay one farthing yearly to the altar of S. Peter,
  in the same cathedral."&mdash;MSS. Bowtell, Downing Coll. Library.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This tax was paid in 1516, but how much later I cannot say.</p>

  <p>The readers of Macaulay will be familiar with the term "heart-money"
  (<i>History</i>, vol. i. p. 283.), and the amusing illustrations he
  produces, from the ballads of the day, of the extreme unpopularity of the
  tax on chimneys, and the hatred in which the "chimney man" was held (i.
  287.) but this was a different impost frown that spoken of above, and
  paid to the king, not to the cathedral. It was collected for the last
  time in 1690, having been first levied in 1653, when, Hume tells us, the
  king's debts had become so&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Intolerable, that the Commons were constrained to vote him an
  extraordinary supply of 1,200,000<i>l.</i>, to be levied by eighteen
  months' assessment, and finding upon enquiry that the several branches of
  the revenue fell much short of the sums they expected, they at last,
  after much delay, voted <i>a new imposition of 2s. on each hearth</i>,
  and this tax they settled on the king during his life."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Some prescribe it (saffron) to be worn with camphire in a bag at the
  pit of the stomach for <i>melancholy</i>; and others affirm that, so
  used, it will cure agues."</p>

  excitet, ægrotumque strangulet."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The origin of the "saffron bag", is probably to be explained by the
  strong aromatic odour of saffron, and the high esteem in which it was
  once held as a medicine; though now it is used chiefly as a colouring
  ingredient and by certain elderly ladies, with antiquated notions, as a
  specific for "striking out" the measles in their grandchildren.</p>

  <p><i>Milton's "Penseroso"</i> (Vol. ii, p. 153.).&mdash;H.A.B. desires
  to understand the couplet&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"And love the high embower'd roof,</p>
      <p>With antique pillars massy proof."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>He is puzzled whether to consider "proof" an adjective belonging to
  "pillars," or a substantive in apposition with it. All the commentators
  seem to have passed the line without observation. I am almost afraid to
  suggest that we should read "pillars'" in the genitive plural, "proof"
  being taken in the sense of <i>established strength</i>.</p>

  <p>Before dismissing this conjecture, I have taken the pains to examine
  every one of the twenty-four other passages in which Milton has used the
  word "proof." I find that it occurs only four times as an adjective in
  all of which it is followed by something dependent upon it. In three of
  than thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"&mdash;&mdash; not proof</p>
      <p>Against temptation."&mdash;<i>Par. L.</i> ix. 298.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"&mdash;&mdash; proof 'gainst all assaults."&mdash;<i>Ib.</i> x. 88.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Proof against all temptation."&mdash;<i>Par. R.</i> iv. 533.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the fourth, which is a little different, thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"&mdash;&mdash; left some part</p>
      <p>Not proof enough such object to sustain."</p>

  </div>
<p><!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>{346}</span></p>

  <p>As Milton, therefore, has in no other place used "proof" as an
  adjective without something attached to it, I feel assured that he did
  not use it as an adjective in the passage in question.</p>

  so long ago as 1843, and no symptom of any other appears, I presume that
  this extremely curious book has, for some reason or other, been
  abandoned. Perhaps the well-known jealousy of the censor may have

  This paper is accompanied by engravings of the ancient water-marks, as
  well as those of more modern times, and enters somewhat largely into the
  question of how far water-marks may be considered as evidence of precise
  dates. They are not always to be relied upon, for in December, 1850,
  there will doubtless be thousands of reams of paper issued and in
  circulation, bearing the date of 1851, unless the practice is altered of
  late years. Timperley's <i>Biographical, Chronological, and Historical

  right-hand side going from Prague to the suburb called the
  <i>Kleinseite</i>. As the story goes, he was offered the most costly
  bribes by <i>Wenzel</i>, king of Bohemia, to betray his trust, and after
  his repeated refusal was put to the torture, and then thrown into the
  Moldau, where he was drowned. The body of the saint was embalmed, and is
  now preserved in a costly silver shrine of almost fabulous worth, in the
  church of St. Veit, in the Kleinseite. In Weber's <i>Briefe eines durch
  Deutschland reisende Deutschen</i>, the weight silver about this shrine

  place in which they are treasured up until the Judgment, is the Divine
  mind. This the poet, by a very allowable figure, calls "Bosom." Homer's
  expression is somewhat analogous.</p>

  <p><i>Anecdote of a Peal of Bells</i> (Vol. i., p. 382.).&mdash;It is
  related of the bells of Limerick Cathedral by Mrs. S.C. Hall
  (<i>Ireland</i>, vol. i., p. 328. note).</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Another correspondent, under the same signature, forwards the legend
  as follows</p>

<p class="center">"THOSE EVENING BELLS."</p>

  <p>"The remarkably fine bells of Limerick Cathedral were originally
  brought from Italy. They had been manufactured by a young native (whose
  name tradition has not preserved), and finished after the toil of many
  years; and he prided himself upon his work. They were subsequently
  purchased by a prior of a neighbouring convent, and, with the profits of
  this sale, the young Italian procured a little villa, where he had the
  pleasure of hearing the tolling of his bells from the convent cliff, and
  of growing old in the bosom of domestic happiness. This, however, was not
  to continue. In some of those broils, whether civil or foreign, which are
  the undying worm in the peace of a fallen land, the good Italian was a
  sufferer amongst many. He lost his all; and after the passing of the
  storm, he found himself preserved alone, amid the wreck of fortune,
  friends, family, and home. The convent in which the bells, the
  chef-d'&#339;uvre of his skill, were hung, was rased to the earth, and
  these last carried away to another land. The unfortunate owner, haunted
  by his memories and deserted by his hopes, became a wanderer over Europe.
  His hair grew gray, and his heart withered, before he again found a home
  and friend. In this desolation of spirit he formed the resolution of
  seeking the place to which those treasures of his memory had finally been
  borne. He sailed for Ireland, proceeded up the Shannon; the vessel
  anchored in the pool near Limerick, and he hired a small boat for the
  purpose of landing. The city was now before him; and he beheld St. Mary's
  steeple lifting its turreted head above the smoke and mist of the old
  town. He sat in the stern, and looked fondly towards it. It was an
  evening so calm and beautiful as to remind him of his own native haven in
  the sweetest time of the year&mdash;the death of spring. The broad stream
  appeared like one smooth mirror, and the little vessel glided through it
  with almost a noiseless expedition. On a sudden, amid the general
  stillness, the bells tolled from the cathedral; the rowers rested on
  their oars, and the vessel went forward with the impulse it had received.
  The old Italian looked towards the city, crossed his arms on his breast,
  and lay back on his seat; home, happiness, early recollections, friends,
  family&mdash;all were in the sound, and went with it to his heart. When
  the rowers looked round, they beheld him with his face still turned
  towards the cathedral, but his eyes were closed, and when they landed
  they found him cold in death."</p>

  <p><i>Codex Flateyensis</i> (Vol. ii., p. 278.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  W.H.F., when referring to the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, requests
  information regarding the <i>Codex Flateyensis</i>, in which is contained
  one of the best MSS. of the Saga above mentioned. W.H.F. labours under
  the misapprehension of regarding the <i>Codex Flateyensis</i> as a mere
  manuscript of the Orkneyinga Saga, whereas that Saga constitutes but a
  very small part of the magnificent volume. The <i>Codex Flateyensis</i>
  takes its name, as W.H.F. rightly concludes, from the island of Flatey in
  the Breidafiord in Iceland, where it was long preserved. It is a
  parchment volume most beautifully executed, the initial letters of the
  chapters being finely illuminated, and extending in many instances, as in
  a fac-simile now before me, from top to bottom of the folio page. The
  contents of the volume may be learned from the following lines on the
  first page; I give it in English as the original is in
  Icelandic:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"John Hakonson owns this book, herein first are written verses, then
  how Norway was colonised, then of Erik the Far-travelled, thereafter of
  Olaf Tryggvason the king with all his deeds, and next is the history of
  Olaf Haraldson, the saint, and of his deeds, <i>and therewith the history
  of the earls of Orkney</i>, then is there Sverrers Saga; thereafter the
  Saga of Hakon the Old, with the Saga of Magnus the king, his son, then
  the deeds of Einar Sokkeson of Greenland, and next of Elga and Ulf the
  Bad; and then begin the annals from the creation of the world to the
  present year. John Thordarson the priest wrote the portion concerning
  Erik the Far-travelled, and the Sagas of both the Olaves; but Magnus
  Thorhallson the priest has written all that follows, as well as all that
  preceded, and has illuminated all (the book). Almighty God and the holy
  virgin mary give joy to those who wrote and to him who dictated."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A little further on we learn from the text that when the book began to
  be written there had elapsed from the birth of Christ 1300 and 80 and 7
  years. The volume was, therefore, commenced in 1387, and finished, as we
  judge from the year at which the annals cease, in 1395. The death of
  Hakon Hakonson is recorded in the last chapters of the Saga of that name,
  which we see is included in the list of those contained in the <i>Codex
  Flateyensis</i>.</p>

  a nose. (Grimm, <i>Deutsche Rechts Alterthümer</i>, p. 299.) I think
  people not able to pay forfeited "the prominence on the face, which is
  the organ of scent, and emunctory of the brain," as good Walker says. It
  was according to the rule, "Qui non habet in ære, luat in pelle." Still
  we "count" or "tell noses," when computing, for instance, how many
  persons of the company are to pay the reckoning. The expression is used

  England. Dr. Cheyne's words are: "I think every man is a fool or a
  physician at thirty years of age, (that is to say), by that time he ought
  to know his own constitution, and unless he is determined to live an
  intemperate and irregular life, I think he may by diet and regimen
  prevent or cure any <i>chronical</i> disease; but as to <i>acute</i>

  given in the <i>Mercurius Rusticus</i>, there is an anecdote which will
  give a reply to the Query of your correspondent K. The commander of the
  Parliamentarian forces was Sir Walter Erle; and it was a great joke with
  his opponents that the pass-word of "Old Wat" had been given (by himself
  I believe) on the night of his last assault on the castle. The chronicler
  informs us that "Old Wat" was the usual notice of a hare being found
  sitting; and the proverbial timidity of that animal suggested some odious
  comparisons with the defeated general.</p>

  <p><i>Scotch Prisoners at Worcester</i> (Vol. ii., p. 297.).&mdash;I
  cannot think that the extract from the accounts of the churchwardens of
  St. Margaret's, Westminster, at all justifies C.F.S. in supposing that
  the Scotch prisoners were massacred in cold blood. The total number of
  these prisoners was 10,000. Of the 1,200 who were buried, the greater
  part most probably died of their wounds; and though this number is large,
  yet we must bear in mind that in those days the sick and wounded were not
  tended with the care and attention which are now displayed in such cases.
  We learn from the <i>Parliamentary History</i> (xx. 58.), that on the
  17th Sep. 1651, "the Scots prisoners were brought to London, and marched
  through the city into Tothill-fields." The same work (xx. 72.) states
  that "Most of the common soldiers were sent to the English Plantations;
  and 1500 of them were granted to the Guiney merchants and sent to work in
  the Gold mines there." Large numbers were also employed in draining the
  great level of the Fens (Wells, <i>History of the Bedford Level</i>, i.
  228-244.). Lord Clarendon (book xiii.) says, "Many perished for want of
  food, and, being enclosed in little room till they were sold to the
  plantations for slaves, they died of all diseases."</p>

  <p>"<i>Antiquitas Sæculi Juventus Mundi</i>" (Vol. ii., p. 218.).&mdash;A
  learned friend, who although involved in the avocations of an active

  favoured me with the following observation on these words:&mdash;"That
  the phrase <i>Antiquitas sæculi juventus mundi</i> is in Italics in
  Bacon's work does not, in my opinion, prove it to be a quotation, any
  more than the words <i>ordine retrogrado</i> in the subsequent passage.
  Italics were used in Bacon's time, and long afterwards, to to mark not
  only quotations, but emphatic words, <span lang="el" title="gnômai"
  >&#x3B3;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, and epigrammatic
  sentences, of which you will every where see instances. I have not the
  original edition of the work, but we have here<a id="footnotetag5"
  name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the rare
  translation into English by Gilbert Wats, Oxford, 1640, folio, through
  which the references to authors are given in the margin; but there is no
  reference appended to this passage. I cannot of course decide positively
  that the phrase is not a quotation, but I incline to the opinion that it
  is not. It may be an adaptation of some proverbial expression; but I
  prefer believing that it is Bacon's own mode of expressing that the
  present times are more ancient (<i>i.e.</i> full of years) than the
  earliest, and thus to show that the respect we entertain for authority is
  unfounded."</p>

  <p>Coleridge was of the same opinion (Introd. to <i>Encycl. Metrop.</i>,
  p. 19.). Had the phrase been a quotation, would not Bacon have said,
  "Sanè ut vere <i>dictum est</i>," rather than "Ut vere
  <i>dicamus</i>."</p>

  <p>The importance of Winchelsea as a convenient port for communication
  with France, from the time of the Conquest to the close of the fifteenth
  century, having led to a wish for a more extended history of that town
  than is to be found in any work relating either to the Cinque Ports or to
  the county of Sussex, Mr. Durrant Cooper determined to gather together
  the existing materials for such a history as a contribution to the Sussex
  Archæological Society. The industry, however, with which Mr. Cooper
  prosecuted his search after original records and other materials
  connected with the town and its varied history, was rewarded by the
  discovery of so many important documents as to render it impossible to
  carry out his original intention. The present separate work, entitled
  <i>The History of Winchelsea, one of the Ancient Towns added to the
  Cinque Ports</i>, is the result of this change; and the good people of
  Winchelsea have now to thank Mr. Cooper for a history of it, which has
  been as carefully prepared as it has been judiciously executed. Mr.
  Cooper has increased the amusement and information to be derived from his
  volume, by the manner in which he has contrived to make transactions of
  great historical importance illustrate his narrative of events of merely
  local interest.</p>

  <p>The new edition of the <i>Pictorial Shakspeare</i> which Mr. Charles
  Knight has just commenced under the title of the "National Edition"
  cannot, we think, prove other than a most successful attempt to circulate
  among all classes, but especially among readers of comparatively small
  means, a cheap, well-edited, and beautifully illustrated edition of the
  works of our great poet. The text of the present edition is not printed,
  <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351"
  id="page351"></a>{351}</span> like of its precursor, in double columns,
  but in a distinct and handsome type extending across the page; and as
  there is no doubt the notes will be revised so as to incorporate the
  amendments and elucidations of the text, which have appeared from our
  Colliers, Hunters, &amp;c., since the <i>Pictorial Shakspeare</i> was
  first published, there can be little doubt but that this <i>National
  Edition</i> will meet with a sale commensurate with the taste and
  enterprise of its editor and publisher, Mr. Knight.</p>

  <p>SHAKSPEARE.&mdash;An Advertisement of a New Edition of Shakspeare
  having appeared from Mr. Vickers of Hollywell Street, accompanied by an
  advertisement, in which he says he has "engaged the services," of Mr.
  Halliwell as editor, Mr. Halliwell begs publicly to state he has no
  knowledge whatever of Mr. Vickers; and that the use of Mr. Halliwell's
  name in that advertisement is entirely made without his authority.</p>

  <p>Another advertisement of a similar work has been issued by Messrs.
  Tallis and Co. of St. John Street, London, announcing the publication by
  them of the Works of Shakspeare, edited, as the advertisement states, by
  Mr. Halliwell. This announcement has also been made entirely without Mr.
  Halliwell's sanction, Mr. H. having no knowledge of that firm.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
